<h2>
HISTORICAL PREFACE
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> WAS passing through the waiting-room of the <i>Morning Journal</i> on a
certain evening last year when my attention was drawn to a man seated in a
corner. He was dressed in black and his appearance was that of the deepest
dejection. In fact upon his face I read the most melancholy despair.
</p>
<p>
He was not weeping, his eyes were dry and almost expressionless and
received the impression of exterior objects like motionless ice. He had
placed upon his knees a small oaken chest, ornamented with ironwork. His
hands were crossed over this object and hung down, accentuating his
dejected appearance.
</p>
<p>
An attendant told me that he had been awaiting my arrival there three long
hours without a movement, without so much as a sigh. I went towards him,
and announcing myself, I invited him to enter my office. I showed him a
seat, but instead of taking it he came straight to my writing-desk and
placed the little oaken chest on it. &ldquo;Sir, this chest belongs to you,&rdquo;
 said he, and his voice seemed far away and indistinct. &ldquo;My friend, M.
Théophraste Longuet, commissioned me to bring it to you. Take it, sir, and
believe me, your servant.&rdquo; As he spoke the man bowed and made a motion
toward the door. I stopped him, however, and said: &ldquo;Why, do not go, I
cannot receive this box without a knowledge of its contents.&rdquo; He replied:
&ldquo;Sir, I do not know what it contains, it is locked and its key is lost.
You might have to break it open to find out the contents.&rdquo; I replied:
&ldquo;Then at least I would like to know to whom I am indebted for bringing it
to me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My friend, M. Théophraste Longuet, called me Adolphe,&rdquo; replied the man,
in a voice so melancholy that it seemed to grow more faint and indistinct
with each syllable.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, if M. Longuet had brought me the chest himself, he would most
certainly have told me what it contains; I expect that M. Longuet,
himself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I also, sir,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;but M. Théophraste Longuet is dead, and I am
his sole executor.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
By this time he had edged his way to the door, and having said these
words, he opened the door and departed. I was taken back by this sudden
move and stood staring at the door, then at the chest. Collecting myself I
hastily followed the man, but could find no trace of him... he had
disappeared.
</p>
<p>
Opening the chest I found it contained a bundle of papers, which at first
I regarded with indifference, but which I presently began to examine with
greater interest. The deeper I penetrated the more mysterious they
appeared to be and the more unexpected were the adventures revealed. In
fact, so strange did they seem that I at first could not believe my
intelligence, and if the proof had not been in front of me I never would
have been convinced of their reality.
</p>
<p>
It was some time before I could bring myself to realize my position
regarding these papers. M. Théophraste Longuet had made me heir to this
chest and to the mysteries lying therein. In fact, the secrets of his
life.
</p>
<p>
These papers were written in the form of memoirs and were voluminous. They
related with the minutest detail, all the incidents of an exceptionally
dramatic existence. M. Théophraste Longuet had by the discovery of a
document two centuries old acquired the proof that Louis Dominique
Cartouche, the most cunning criminal in the annals of French crime, and
he, Théophraste, were one and the same person. This was indeed a most
startling discovery and valuable, for it also put me on the track of the
treasures of the famous Cartouche.
</p>
<p>
He had frequently confided in me facts about his peculiar life, but an
untimely death, certain terrible events related in these documents, had
prevented him from telling me all. We had been great friends. I had
written for a journal he had called his &ldquo;favorite organ.&rdquo; He had chosen me
as his companion and confidant from among many other journalists, not
because of any superiority of intellect, but rather, as he used to say,
&ldquo;because a reliable level-headed friend is worth twenty acquaintances, and
he found me reliable.&rdquo; There was much significance in this word,
&ldquo;level-headed,&rdquo; as you will learn as you read this narrative.
</p>
<p>
Having thoroughly examined the papers, I immediately took them to my
manager, who was a keen business man. He did not hesitate for a moment to
find the &ldquo;Treasures of Cartouche&rdquo; a valuable piece for his paper, and it
is now a matter of common knowledge how curiously the sum of twenty-five
thousand francs, divided into seven sums, were hidden in and around Paris,
and how the author of these lines in the history of the chest which
appeared in print in the month of October, in the year 1903, * touched
lightly upon the story found therein.
</p>
<p>
* This date is very important, for it established the fact that my
authentic history of Cartouche had appeared before Mr. Frank Brentano&rsquo;s
book, and that one two books the day after that of Mr. Maurice Bernard.
</p>
<p>
I have believed it my duty toward the public, and also to the memory of
Théophraste Longuet, to publish in volume the authentic history of the
reincarnation of Cartouche, written exclusively from the documents found
in the little oaken chest, a plain narrative, unembellished by all that
which I, poor journalist, had added for the chance reader of my journal.
</p>
<p>
The reader will find more than a mere treasure. The documents are of the
greatest literary value, inasmuch as they contain proof of things hitherto
only dreamt of. It is certain that many people imagining themselves of
superior intellect will doubt and possibly scoff at many of these
mysteries.
</p>
<p>
The oaken chest contained the secret of the tomb; it also contained the
history of the Talpa people written by no less an authority than M.
Milfroid, Commissioner of Police, who remained for three weeks with M.
Théophraste Longuet in the subterranean home of those monsters. This last
infernal comedy would most certainly have met with incredulity had not it
been vented by one of the most honest and intellectual of Police
Commissioners. M. Milfroid was a most noble and accomplished character,
and he could place music, painting, sculptors among his accomplishments.
</p>
<p>
Now before closing this preface I must warn my readers that they will find
many strange things in the narrative, weird and almost supernatural. And I
would say that unless he is possessed with great level-headedness, he must
not read the secrets of the Life of Théophraste Longuet.

<h2>
CHAPTER I
</h2>
<h3>
<i>M. Théophraste Longuet Wishes to Inform Him-self and Visits Historical
Monuments</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE strange adventures of M. Théophraste Longuet, which ended so
tragically, originated in a visit to the prison of the Conciergerie, on
the 28th of June, 1899. Therefore this history is modern; but the writer
would say that, having read and examined all the papers and writings of M.
Théophraste Longuet, its recentness does not detract from its sensational
character.
</p>
<p>
When M. Longuet rang the bell of the Conciergerie he was accompanied by
his wife, Marceline, and M. Adolphe Lecamus. The latter was a close
friend. It was his physique that had attracted M. Longuet. He was not
handsome, but was tall and well built, and every movement showed that
strength which M. Longuet lacked. His forehead was broad and convex, his
eyebrows were heavy and straight. He had a habit of every now and then
lifting them gracefully to express his disdain of others and his
confidence in himself. His grey eyes twinkled under near-sighted
spectacles, and the straight nose, the proud arch of the underlip,
surmounted by a dark, flowing mustache, the square outline of his chin and
his amaranthine complexion, all combined to accentuate his strong
appearance.
</p>
<p>
He had been employed as postmaster at Turin, and had traveled
considerably. He had crossed the sea. This was also an attraction to M.
Longuet, who had never crossed anything, unless it was the Seine.
</p>
<p>
M. Longuet had been a rubber stamp manufacturer, but had made sufficient
money to retire at an early age. He was the antithesis of Adolphe in build
and character. His face showed no marked intelligence, and his slight
build lent almost insignificance to his appearance. He had, however,
imagination, and he used to laughingly say to Adolphe: &ldquo;Even if I haven&rsquo;t
traveled, I run just as much risk in walking the streets of Paris as one
who crosses the ocean in ships. Might not houses collapse or pots of
flowers fall on one&rsquo;s head?&rdquo; Thus he lived a monotonous existence,
relieved only by the morbid workings of his mind.
</p>
<p>
Before his retirement he had worked hard and had little time to study,
therefore, now he had leisure, it occurred to him to occupy his time in
improving his mind. It was with this intention that we find him visiting
the various buildings of historic interest around Paris.
</p>
<p>
On ringing the bell of the Conciergerie the iron door turned heavily on
its hinges. A warden shaking the keys demanded of Théophraste his permit.
He had anticipated this and had received it that morning from the Prefect
of Police. He tendered it with satisfaction, looking around at his
companion with the confidence of anticipations realized.
</p>
<p>
The gate-keeper turned the little company over to the Chief Warden, who
was passing at the time. Marceline was much impressed, and as she leaned
on Adolphe&rsquo;s arm, thought of Marie Antoinette&rsquo;s dungeon, the Grevin
Museum, and all the mysteries of this famous prison. The Chief Warden
said: &ldquo;Are you French?&rdquo; to which Théophraste replied, laughingly, for he
was typically French: &ldquo;Do we look like English people?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This is the first time,&rdquo; explained the Chief Warden, &ldquo;that any French
people have asked permission to visit the Conciergerie. French people are
indifferent to things of interest in their own country.&rdquo; &ldquo;They are wrong,
sir,&rdquo; replied Théophraste, wiping his spectacles. &ldquo;In the monuments of the
past we have foundations of the future.&rdquo; This idea rather pleased him, and
he looked for approval to Adolphe and Marceline. He continued following
the Warden. &ldquo;As for me, I am an old Parisian and would have visited all
these places of interest long ago but for my work. I have worked hard at
my trade and the only leisure I got was when I went to bed. That time is
over now, sir, and now is the time for me to educate myself,&rdquo; and he
struck the century-old pavement with the end of his green umbrella.
</p>
<p>
Passing a small door and a large wicket, they descended some steps and
were in the guard-room. The first thing to draw attention made Adolphe
laugh, Marceline blush, and Théophraste turn in disgust. It was the
capital of a Gothic column carved to symbolize the story of Abelard and
Heloise. Abelard was pleading with the Carion Fulbert for his clemency,
while the latter was taking the child from Heloise.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; said M. Longuet, &ldquo;that in the name of art the Government
should tolerate such obscenities. That capital is a disgrace to the
Conciergerie and should be removed.&rdquo; M. Lecamus did not agree, and said:
&ldquo;Many things are excusable in art if they are done in the right spirit.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
However, the subject was dropped and they were soon interested in other
parts of these old historic buildings. The Chief Warden conducted them
through the Tower of Cæsar, into the Silver Tower, or Tower of Bon Bee.
They thought of the thousand of illustrious prisoners who had been
incarcerated in prison for years. Marceline could not keep from thinking
of the martyred Marie Antoinette, of Elizabeth, and the little Dauphin,
and of the waxen gendarmes in the museum, who watched over the Royal
family. All this impressed her, and her mind was continually carried back
to those stirring times. The Silver Tower had been transformed into a
record office, and the modern writing desks were in striking contrast to
the old medieval walls. Returning through the guard-room, they directed
their steps towards the Bon Bee Tower. Théophraste had read about this
tower and imagined he knew it well, so wishing to appear well informed,
asked of the Warden, &ldquo;Is it not there, sir, that the last meal of the
Girondists was served? You ought certainly to tell us exactly where to
find the table, and also the place which Camille des Moulins occupied.&rdquo;
 The Warden replied that the Environdists had dined in the chapel and that
they would soon visit it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish to know Camille des Moulins&rsquo; place,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;because he
was a friend of mine.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And mine also,&rdquo; said Marceline, with a look towards Adolphe, which seemed
to say, &ldquo;Not as much as you, Adolphe.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
But Adolphe laughed and said Camille was not a Girondist, he was a
Franciscan friar, a friend of Danton, a Septembrian.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste was vexed, and Marceline protested that if he had been
anything of the sort Lucille would not have married him. Adolphe did not
insist, but as they had by now reached the chamber of torture, he feigned
condescendingly to be interested in the labels which adorned the drawers
decorating the walls, &ldquo;Hops,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cinnamon,&rdquo; &ldquo;Spice,&rdquo; etc.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here is the room in question. They have transformed it into the doctor&rsquo;s
store-room.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is just as well, perhaps,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;but not so impressive.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Adolphe and Marceline were of the same opinion. They were not at all
impressed. Here was the famous torture chamber. They expected something
else. They were disillusioned. Outside, when viewed from the court of the
Sundial, the formidable aspect of those old feudal towers, the last
vestige of the palace of the French monarchy, momentarily brought fear and
awe to their minds. That prison had stood a thousand years, had known so
many tragedies, death rattles, legendary miseries, hidden secrets. It
seemed that one only had to step inside to find an inquisition court in
some dark corner, damp and funereal. Here seemed to be all the tragedies
of the history of Paris, as immortal as the very walls.
</p>
<p>
What a disillusion here in these towers with a little plaster and paint
they had made the office of the Director of Records, the store-room of the
prison doctor. One could carouse here where once the hangman held sway.
One could laugh where only the cries of the tortured were heard.
</p>
<p>
Now there would have been nothing unusual about this visit to the
Conciergerie but for a very extraordinary incident which occurred after
the party had left the torture chamber. The incident was weird and
inexplicable, and while I read M. Longuet&rsquo;s own description of it, I
confess I found it impossible to believe. Therefore I went to the Chief
Warden, who had shown the party round the prison, and asked for his
account of the incident.
</p>
<p>
He gave it to me in the following words:
</p>
<p>
Sir, the affair passed as usual, and the lady, the two gentlemen and I
visited the kitchen of St. Louis, which is now used as a store-house for
plaster. We proceeded towards the dungeon of Marie Antoinette, which is
now the chapel. On the way I showed them the crucifix, before which she
prayed before mounting the cart which is now in the Director&rsquo;s room. I
told the man with the green umbrella that we had been obliged to transfer
the Queen&rsquo;s arm-chair to the Director&rsquo;s room, because the English visitors
had carried away pieces from it as souvenirs. We had by this time arrived
at the end of the Street of Paris-you know the street that leads from
Paris to the Conciergerie. We passed through that frightfully dark
passage, where we found the grating behind which they cut off the hair of
the women before execution. You know that it is the very same grating. It
is a passage where never a ray of sunlight penetrates. Marie Antoinette
walked through that passage on the day of her death. It is there that the
old Conciergerie stands just as it was hundreds of years ago.
</p>
<p>
I was describing the Street of Paris, when suddenly the man with the green
umbrella cried out in a voice so unlike the previous voice, so strangely
that the other gentleman and lady looked startled: &ldquo;Zounds, it is the walk
of the Straw Dealers.&rdquo; He said it in a weird tone and his whole attitude
was changed. He used the expression, zounds, twice. I told him he was
mistaken, that the walk of the Straw Dealers is what we call to-day the
Street of Paris. He answered me in the same strange voice: &ldquo;Zounds, you
cannot tell me that! I have lain there on that straw like the others!&rdquo; I
remarked to him, smilingly, although not without a feeling of fear, that
no one had lain on that straw in the alley of the Straw Dealers for more
than two hundred years.
</p>
<p>
He was just about to answer me when his wife intervened. &ldquo;What are you
saying, Théophraste?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Do you wish to teach Monsieur his
business? You have never been to the Conciergerie before.&rdquo; Then he said in
his natural voice, the voice by which I had known him at first: &ldquo;That is
so, I have never been here before.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I could not understand then at all, but thought the incident closed, when
he did something stranger still.
</p>
<p>
We visited the Queen&rsquo;s Dungeon, Robespierre&rsquo;s Dungeon, the Chapel of the
Girondists, and that little gate, which is still the same as when the
unfortunate prisoners, called the Septembrians, leaped over it to be
massacred in the court. We were now in the Street of Paris. There was a
little stairway on the left which we did not descend. It led to the
cellars which I did not deem necessary to show, as it was dark and
difficult of access. The gate at the bottom of this staircase is closed by
a grating which is perhaps a thousand years old-possibly more. The
gentleman, whom they called Adolphe, proceeded with the lady toward the
door leading out of the guard-room, but without saying a word the man with
the green umbrella descended the little staircase. When he was at the
grating he cried out in that strange, weird voice: &ldquo;Well, where are you
going? It is here.&rdquo; The gentleman and the lady stopped as if petrified.
The voice was terrible, and nothing in the outward appearance of the man
would make you believe that the voice came from him. In spite of my fear I
ran to the head of the stairs. I was thunderstruck. He ordered me to open
the grating, and I don&rsquo;t know how I obeyed him. It was as if I had been
hypnotized. I obeyed mechanically. Then when the grating was opened he
disappeared in the darkness of the cellar. Where had he gone? How could he
find his way? Those subterranean passages of the Conciergerie are plunged
in frightful darkness and nobody has been down there for centuries and
centuries.
</p>
<p>
He had already gone too far for me to stop him. He had hypnotized me. I
stayed about a quarter of an hour at the entrance of that dark hole. His
companions were in the same state as I was. It was impossible to follow
him. Then suddenly we heard his voice, not his first voice, but his
second. I was so startled I had to cling to the grating for support. He
cried out: &ldquo;It is thou, Simon l&rsquo;Anvergust.&rdquo; I could not answer. He passed
near me, and as he passed it seemed to me that he put a scrap of paper in
his jacket pocket. He leaped up the steps with one bound and rejoined the
lady and gentleman. He gave them no explanation. As for me, I ran to open
the door of the prison for them. I wanted to get them outside. When the
wicket was open and the man with the green umbrella was walking out,
without apparent reason he said: &ldquo;We must avoid the wheel.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know
what he meant, as there was no carriage near.

CHAPTER II
</h2>
<h3>
<i>An Explanation from Théophraste</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>OW in reading the last chapter one would immediately think that M.
Longuet had gone mad. What had possessed him? Where did he go? In order
that you might fully understand his peculiar actions I will give you the
extract from his memoirs relating to this incident. He writes:
</p>
<p>
I am a man of sound body and mind. I am a good citizen and recognize all
the laws. I believe laws are necessary for the proper regulation of
society. I dislike heartily any formalities, and in determining my lines
of conduct I have always chosen the simplest way.
</p>
<p>
I dislike imaginative people, and the occult has always been repulsive to
me. However, this is not through want of understanding, for my friend,
Adolphe Lecamus, had given himself up to the study of spiritualism.
Whoever teaches spiritualism teaches foolishness, and the desire to
question the spirits of the dead by means of the planchette seems to me to
be beyond belief, it is grotesque. However, I have assisted at some of
Adolphe&rsquo;s seances which he had given for the benefit of Marceline and
myself. I have even taken a certain part in them, desiring to prove the
absurdity of his theories. My wife and I once rested our hands on a table
for a quarter of an hour waiting for it to move. Nothing happened, and we
laughed heartily at him. However, my wife was more sympathetic, and was
inclined to be a little more serious. Women are always more susceptible to
the occult and ready to believe in the mysterious. Adolphe bought her
books, which she read eagerly, and he amused himself sometimes by willing
her to sleep, by making passes with his hands and breathing on her eyes.
It seemed foolish, and I should not have allowed it from any one else, but
I have always had a liking for Adolphe, and know that it amuses him.
Marceline and he said that I was a skeptic. However, I am not a skeptic,
as a skeptic is one who doubts all. I believe in progress, but do not
believe that one person having an unnatural influence over another tends
towards progress. Therefore I am not a skeptic, but rather a philosopher.
</p>
<p>
During his travels Adolphe read a great deal. I have had to work hard all
my life, therefore, while he is an idealist, I am a materialist.
</p>
<p>
It seems necessary for me to thus describe my character so that it may be
well understood that the happenings of the day before yesterday were not
due to any occult reasons. I visited the prison in just the same manner as
I would go to a store to buy a cravat. I wanted to learn, that is all.
Having sold my business, I have more leisure, and so I said to myself: &ldquo;I
will visit the interesting places of the city of Paris.&rdquo; Fate decreed that
the Conciergerie was the first place to be visited. I do not know whether
I really regret it.
</p>
<p>
At present I am calm and collected and can relate all I remember of what
happened.
</p>
<p>
While we were in the Towers nothing happened worth recording. I remember
trying to picture to myself in the little room which looked like a grocery
store all the horrors of the place, how the executioners and their
assistants approached the prisoners with their monstrous machines, how so
many illustrious persons were martyred, and all the terrible griefs and
agonies which had been witnessed within these walls. But the
transformation had taken all the romance away, and the labels, &ldquo;Senna,&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Hops,&rdquo; etc., did not inspire imagination. Even the Bon Bee Tower, also
called Bavarde, on account of the terrible cries which were heard in it,
has been changed into offices. However, I must not complain. These are all
the signs of progress and a more enlightened age.
</p>
<p>
But we penetrated into that part of the Conciergerie which has changed
little during all these centuries, which had not been spoiled by the
plasterer and in which all the stones could tell their own history; then
it was that a most inexplicable fever took possession of me, and when we
had reached the dark end of the walk of the &ldquo;Straw Dealers,&rdquo; I cried out
from my soul, &ldquo;Zounds! this is the walk of the Straw Dealers.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I turned around immediately to find out who had uttered these words. They
were all staring at me, and I was convinced that it was myself who had
cried out. It seemed so strange. The voice was not like mine, but it had
emanated from me. Even now it is unaccountable.
</p>
<p>
The Warden pretended that we had passed the walk of the &ldquo;Straw Dealers.&rdquo; I
told him that I knew the place better than he, for I had lain there on the
straw myself. But I had never been in the Conciergerie before, and yet I
was sure of it. It is difficult to explain. While we walked through the
chapel of the Girondists, and the Warden was explaining the story to us, I
played with my umbrella. I tried to appear natural and collected. Although
the things which happened were quite natural, and not the result of any
effort, a cold perspiration seized me and I shook like a leaf. I remember
that I found myself at the bottom of the stairs, standing before a
grating. I was endowed with almost superhuman strength. Shaking the
grating, I called out for the others to follow. However, the others had
gone ahead and did not hear. I called to the Warden to open the grating. I
don&rsquo;t know what would have happened if he had not done so, quickly. I was
crazy, and yet everything was natural to me. Truly, I was in a state of
great nervous excitement, but everything was lucid to me. Never before had
I seen so clearly as when in that dark cellar. Never before had I
recognized a place so vividly as when I was down there where I had never
been before. My God! I did not know them, and yet I recognized them.
</p>
<p>
Without hesitating I groped around, feeling the stones in the dark, and my
feet trod a soil which seemed familiar but which had not been trodden for
centuries. I seemed to know these very stones, forgotten in the darkness
of those cellars. I slid the length of the damp flagstones as if I had
been accustomed to the way. My finger-nails came in contact with sharp
stones in the wall and I counted the seams as I passed. I knew that if I
turned round I would see a certain square light in the distant gallery, a
single ray in all this place where the sun had forgotten to shine since
France&rsquo;s history had begun. I turned and saw it, and I felt my heart beat
violently.
</p>
<p>
Here there was a momentary interruption in the writings. M. Longuet,
having explained what had happened to him in that strange hour in the
Conciergerie, was greatly agitated. It was with difficulty he remained
master of his thoughts. It was difficult to follow them; they seemed to
come and go, just leaving faint traces on the paper of the record.
</p>
<p>
He resumed the pen with feverish hand. Continuing to busy himself with the
subterranean passages, he writes:
</p>
<p>
It is necessary to pause here as one pauses at the edge of a precipice. My
very thoughts make me shiver!...
</p>
<p>
And the Bavarde, there it stands. There are the walls which have helped to
make history. It is not on high in the glorious sunlight that the Bavarde
tells its history. It is here in the blackness of the earth. There are
some large iron staples in the wall here. The very chains of Ravaillac! I
recall no more; but towards that ray, the sole ray of light, as eternal
and immovable as the very walls- towards that small square beam, which
since the beginning of things has taken and kept the shape of a sentinel,
I advanced. There was some impelling force which urged me on. I rushed
ahead while the fever was in me and seemed to intoxicate me. Suddenly I
paused, my feet seemed held to the ground and my fingers ran sliding and
pressing the length of the wall. What it was that impelled my finger, what
was the thought, I cannot tell. All at once I let my umbrella fall, and
drawing my pen-knife, began to scrape steadily between two stones. The
dust and cement powdered away easily, and soon my knife struck something
between the stones, and I pulled the thing out.
</p>
<p>
This is why I am sure I was not mad. This thing has been before my eyes.
In my most peaceful hours I, Théophraste Longuet, see it in my
writing-desk. It is not I who am mad, but this thing itself! It is a piece
of torn paper, stained. . . a document of which it is easy to tell the age
and calculated to plunge any man into the deepest consternation.
</p>
<p>
The paper is, as you must know, terribly decayed. The dampness has eaten
into half the words, which seem, on account of their reddish tint, to have
been written with blood.
</p>
<p>
I took the document to the small ray of light, and on looking it over my
hair seemed to stand on end with horror. <i>There I could recognize my own
handwriting</i>, and I give you this precious and mysterious document
clearly translated:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dead and buried all his treasures after the Treachery of April 1st. Go,
take a look in the barroom! Look at the furnace! Look at the weathercock!
Dig a while and you shall be rich!&rdquo;

CHAPTER III
</h2>
<h3>
<i>A Search and a Discovery</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>. ADOLPHE LECAMUS and Marceline thought M. Théophraste&rsquo;s actions
strange, but they were too much occupied with an affair of their own to
attach very great importance to them. However, M. Théophraste concealed
his anxiety and pretended that the visit to the Conciergerie was quite a
natural occurrence. He had gone down in the cellars just to satisfy a
natural curiosity, not being one of those who make a superficial
inspection of things of interest.
</p>
<p>
The following day, M. Théophraste, under the pretext of putting his
affairs in order, shut himself up in his office and gave instructions for
nobody to disturb him. Leaning over the balcony he looked out upon the
little square of Anvers and reflected over the happenings of yesterday.
There was nothing in the view to distract him. He was accustomed to the
scene below: nurses pushing perambulators gossiping over the latest news,
and a few professors walking towards the Rollie College. The Avenue
Touraine rang with the shouts of college students who had come before the
lecture hour.
</p>
<p>
Nothing had changed; the world was just the same. To-day, like yesterday,
or like the day before yesterday. The people were going to their business
just the same. Even Nidine Petito, the wife of the Italian professor, who
lived in the apartment below, was the same. She began to play the
&ldquo;Carnival of Venice&rdquo; on the piano just as she did every day.
</p>
<p>
Nothing had changed; thus he reflected. On turning round he could see
amongst his papers on the desk, the document. Did it really exist? He had
passed a restless night and was now attributing his strange adventure to a
bad dream-but no, it could not be that, for there was the paper on his
desk, in his own handwriting, and written in blood. Good God! perhaps it
was his own blood. What thoughts, what thoughts!
</p>
<p>
Théophraste passed his hand over his forehead. He was perspiring and
restless. Suddenly breathing a sigh and slapping his thigh with his hand,
he appeared to have come to a definite resolution, and put the paper
carefully away in his portfolio.
</p>
<p>
He remembered that Signor Petito, the Italian professor, was an expert in
handwriting and that he had had experience in engraving. He would take the
document to him and ask his opinion. His friend Adolphe was also
interested in graphology, but only in a spiritual way, and so he would not
confide in him. There was already too much mystery in the affair without
mixing it up with spiritualism and mediums.
</p>
<p>
He had only known the professor to bow to on the stairs, and so in
presenting himself he was introduced. The professor greeted him cordially,
and after the usual formalities, Théophraste broached the subject of his
visit. He produced the paper, and a letter which he had written some time
previously. &ldquo;Signor Petito,&rdquo; he commenced, &ldquo;having heard of your renown as
an expert in handwriting, I would be grateful to you if you would examine
this letter, and this document, and give me the result of your
observations. I may say that there is no connection between the two
papers.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste was not in the habit of lying, and blushed redder than a
peony. But Signor Petito was already deeply engrossed in the examining of
the two papers. His scholarly eye looked over one, then the other. He
placed them together, held them up to the light, passed his hand over the
writing, and measured them. Then he laughed, showing his white teeth.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Monsieur Longuet,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is not necessary for me to keep you
waiting long for a reply. This document is in a very bad condition, but
the specimen of handwriting can still be read. They are in every way
similar to the letter, and I would swear before any tribunal that those
two handwritings have been traced by the same hand.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Then he entered into details. &ldquo;A child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;could not be mistaken
about it.&rdquo; He pointed out how this duplicate writing was identically
angular. &ldquo;We call a handwriting angular, Monsieur, when the hair-strokes
which join the bottom of the letters and the separate letters are at an
acute angle to the down-strokes of the letters. Do you understand? Compare
this hook and that one, those hair-strokes with these others, and all
those letters getting larger, larger in both writing and in equal measure.
But what a clear writing, Monsieur; I have never seen such clear writing
before. As clear as if cut with a knife.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
By this time Théophraste had become white with nervousness. Signor Petito
thought that he was going to faint. However, he arose, picked up the
document and the letter, and having thanked Signor Petito, he went out.
</p>
<p>
He wandered the streets for a long time, and at last turning down a small
street, he stood in front of an old door in the Rue Inger. Entering, he
found himself in a narrow, dark passage. A man came out of a back room,
and on recognizing Théophraste, greeted him in a friendly way. He was
wearing a square paper cap, and had on a black gown which reached down to
his feet.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good-day, Théophraste, good-day. What happy chance has brought you here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
As it had been two years since they had last seen each other they at first
spoke of family matters and other generalities. Ambrose spoke of his trade
of engraving visiting cards. He had been a printer. He had been a printer
in the province, but having put all he had into an invention for a new
paper, he had failed. He was a distant cousin to Marceline, and when he
was deep in financial troubles, Théophraste had come to his rescue.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste seated himself on the wicker chair in the small room which
served as a workshop. This room was lighted by a large window reaching
from floor to ceiling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ambrose, you are an expert. No one can approach you in the knowledge of
papers, eh?&rdquo; &ldquo;That is not quite true,&rdquo; said Ambrose, &ldquo;but I can judge a
good paper.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You understand all kinds?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;All kinds.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If some one showed you a piece of paper, could you tell the age of it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ambrose, &ldquo;I could. I have published a treatise on the
water-marks of papers used in France in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries. That study was accepted by the Academy.&rdquo; &ldquo;I know, and I have
great respect for your knowledge.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, the thing is simple. The oldest paper showed a plain, glossy
surface, but soon there appeared wide lines crossed at intervals by
perpendicular lines, both giving the impression of a metal trellis over
which the paste had been spread. From the fourteenth century they used
these as a maker&rsquo;s mark, and in the end they designed figures in brass
wire, initials, words, emblems of all sorts -these are the water-marks.
Every sheet of water-marked paper tells its tale, and the year of its make
can be detected, but the difficulty is to decipher it. This necessitates a
little practice.&rdquo; Théophraste opened his portfolio and took out the paper.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Can you tell me the exact date of this?&rdquo; Ambrose put on his eyeglass and
took the paper to the daylight.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is the date,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;172&mdash;, the last figure is rubbed out.
It must be of the eighteenth century.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;I saw that date quite well, but do you really
think that the paper is-of that century? Does not the date lie? That is
what I want to know.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Ambrose showed him the center of the paper. &ldquo;See?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste said nothing. Then Ambrose lit a small lamp and held the paper
up before it. In illuminating the document one could detect in the
thickness of the paper the design of a crown.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Théophraste,&rdquo; said Ambrose excitedly, &ldquo;that paper is exceedingly rare.
That mark is almost unknown, for a very little paper was made with that
sign, which is called the Crown of Thorns. That paper, my dear
Théophraste, was made in 1721.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are sure?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but tell me,&rdquo; cried Ambrose, who could not conceal his surprise,
&ldquo;how is it that this document, dated 1721, could be by all visible marks
in your handwriting?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste said nothing, but getting up and putting the document back
into the portfolio, he hastened out of the house.
</p>
<p>
And so here was proof enough. He could doubt it no longer. This paper,
dated in the beginning of the eighteenth century, in the time of the
Regents, this sheet that he had sought for in the prison, distinctly bore
his own handwriting. He had written on that sheet, he, Théophraste
Longuet, late maker of rubber stamps, who retired last week at the age of
41-he wrote on that sheet of paper these incomprehensible words in 1721.
However, it did not want Signor Petito or Ambrose to prove it to him. He
knew it himself. Everything within him cried out, &ldquo;It is your paper!&rdquo; And
so instead of being Théophraste Longuet, son of John Longuet, master
gardener to the Ferte sous Jonaise, he had been in the past some one he
did not know, but who had been reborn in him. Yes, that was it, and he now
had the great desire to recall having lived 200 years.
</p>
<p>
Who was he? What was his name? In which body had his immortal soul elected
momentarily to live? He felt certain that these questions would not remain
long unanswered. Was it true that some of the things ignored in his
present existence constituted part of his past life? What was meant by
certain expressions spoken in the Conciergerie? Who, then, was Simon de
Anvergust, whose name had been twice repeated by his burning lips?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes, the name, in former times my own, his also,&rdquo; wrote Théophraste
in his journal, &ldquo;arose from my awakened brain, and knowing who I was, I
recalled the whole life lived in former years, and I read in a flash from
that piece of paper all the details of a past life.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Monsieur Théophraste Longuet, to state the matter frankly, had not arrived
at the conclusion without having, in these incoherent lines, wandered
before. The happenings of these days were too unusual. Imagine, he was
simple-minded, a little heavy, a little foppish, he had never invented
anything in his life. He was just an amiable, honest citizen, stupid and
headstrong. He had no religion. He left that to the women, and without
declaring his atheism, used to say: &ldquo;When one dies, it is forever.&rdquo;
 However, now he had discovered by an extraordinary incident, that one
never dies. He had to support this, and in doing so declared that not even
those in the business, in occult science, frequenting spirits daily, could
have such palpable proof. In the end Théophraste made his resolution
quickly.
</p>
<p>
This anterior existence could no longer be denied, although he knew
nothing about it. In the uncertainty of his mind he could not associate
the date 1721 with his visit to the Conciergerie.
</p>
<p>
However, he came to this final conclusion. In 1721 he had been confined in
the Conciergerie Prison, probably as a prisoner of state. He could not
admit for a second that he, Théophraste Longuet, had been shut up, even
under Louis XV, as a common criminal. In a solemn moment, perhaps before
being put to torture, he had drawn up this document and hidden the paper
between the stones in the dungeon, and passing by there two centuries
later, had found it again. This was simple enough and not the result of
any supernatural inspiration. The facts themselves were enough.
</p>
<p>
Certain words of the document were in themselves quite natural and of the
most momentous importance. These were &ldquo;Treasure... treachery of the first
of April.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was with these words that he hoped to discover his identity. First, he
had been rich and powerful. The words about the treasure showed
conclusively that the man had been rich and that he had buried his
treasure. He had been powerful and had been betrayed. Théophraste had in
his mind that the treason had been a memorable treason, perhaps
historic-the treachery of the first of April.
</p>
<p>
Yes, all the oddities and all the mysteries of the document left at least
a glimpse of something certain: that he had been a great personage, that
he had buried his treasures; and that after having buried them
mysteriously, more mysteriously still revealed their existence, at the
price of much cunning; perhaps at the price of his own blood. Without
doubt those tinted words had been written with blood.
</p>
<p>
Later he proposed to ask a distinguished chemist to examine it. The
treasures belonged to him, and if necessary he would use this document to
establish his right to them.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste was not rich. He had retired from business with a modest
little income. He had a comfortable little house with a garden and bowling
alley. However, this was little, with the somewhat extravagant tastes of
Marceline, and so the treasure would be most acceptable. He therefore
applied himself diligently to the research.
</p>
<p>
It must be said, though, to his credit, that he was much more puzzled by
the mystery of his personality than by the mystery of the treasure, and
that he resolved to temporarily suspend his research until the time when
he could at least give a name to this personage that he had
been-Théophraste Longuet in 1721. That discovery which interested him most
came to be in his mind the key of all the others.
</p>
<p>
That which astonished him most was the sudden development of what he
called his &ldquo;historical instinct,&rdquo; the instinct which had been deficient in
him all his life, but which had been revealed to him with the suddenness
and force of a clap of thunder in the depths of the Conciergerie. In one
moment, the Other, as he used to say in conversing of this great
18th-century personage, had possessed him. It was the Other who had found
the document; it was the Other who had cried out in the Conciergerie; it
was the Other who had called to Simon l&rsquo;Anvergust, and since the Other had
disappeared, Théophraste did not know what had become of him. He sought
him in vain; he examined himself; he searched his very soul.
</p>
<p>
Before this adventure Théophraste had no curiosity about the beginning or
ending of things, he had not wasted time in wondering over philosophical
mysteries; in his vanity he had always shrugged his shoulders at such
things. However, now things were different; here was a quiet citizen, with
little scientific knowledge, who had to prove that a manufacturer of India
rubber in the year 1899 had been shut up in a dungeon after having buried
treasures in 1721. But the revelation of this extraordinary fact had come
to him spontaneously and remained so fixed in his mind that he resolved to
probe the matter to the bottom.
</p>
<p>
His instinct abandoned him momentarily and he would search books and
discover who this powerful, rich person was who had been betrayed on April
1st; which April 1st? This remained to be determined. He haunted the
libraries from that time on. He marshaled before him the Premiers of the
Kingdom. He found nothing to give him a clue. Some dukes and peers, some
illustrious generals, some great financiers, a few princes of the blood.
He stopped an instant at Law, but he was too dissipated; at Maurice de
Saxe, who ought to have won the Battle of Fontenoy; at the Count du Barry,
who had had the most beautiful mistress in Paris. He feared that perhaps
he had been the Count de Charolais, who distinguished himself by his
debauches, and killed the thatchers on the roofs by shooting at them. He
was forty-eight hours the Cardinal of Palegria, but was disgusted when he
learned that his Eminence had been a farm hand for the Duchess of Maine.
It was refreshing to find in some corner of history a sympathetic count or
lord that the writers of the epoch had adorned in engaging colors and on
whom they had bestowed some virtues. But Théophraste soon saw that all
these would have to be abandoned. For none of them had the principal
qualifications of having been shut up in the Conciergerie in 1721, or
having been betrayed on an April 1st.
</p>
<p>
However, in the Journal of the Barber, he discovered a bastard of the
Regent, about whom were some startling facts which precipitated him into a
state of great excitement.

CHAPTER IV
</h2>
<h3>
<i>Some Philosophy and a Song</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ET us leave Paris awhile and return to the little estate on the banks of
the Marne, which Théophraste generally moved to with the first rays of the
July sun. This year he was to go there before Marceline and his friend,
Adolphe, who had been commissioned to survey the timbers on some lands
elsewhere. Thus these last few days he could spend alone in security and
peace to attend to this unusual treatise which his new position in the
world had given him.
</p>
<p>
The name of the house was &ldquo;Villa Flots d&rsquo;Azure.&rdquo; Théophraste had given it
this name against the wishes of Adolphe, who protested that the name was
for a villa near the sea. He had replied with logic that he had often gone
to the Preport, and that he had always seen the sea green; that he knew
the Marne, and that on account of the reflected blue sky the water seemed
blue. Do they not say &ldquo;the beautiful blue Danube&rdquo;? It was not only the
ocean that had blue waves, so he did not see why he should not call his
villa on the Marne &ldquo;Villa Flots d&rsquo;Azure.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
That day was the anniversary of their marriage. Théophraste was very fond
of Marceline, and these anniversaries were always the occasion for much
merry-making. Marceline also loved Théophraste, and saw no reason why she
should not like Adolphe equally as well, whereas, on the other side,
Adolphe adored Marceline and would have died for Théophraste. On
reflection, the name &ldquo;Villa Flots d&rsquo;Amour&rdquo; would have been more
appropriate than &ldquo;Villa Flots d&rsquo;Azure,&rdquo; such harmony existed therein.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste shook Adolphe&rsquo;s hand effusively. He complimented his wife on
her beauty. He had his green umbrella that day, and in making his
congratulations twirled it in a fashion, as he thought, resembling the
manner in which they used canes in the beginning of the eighteenth
century. He was not a vain person, but he knew by this scientific miracle
that he had been a great man two hundred years ago, and he felt that he
should convey the impression that he had moved among great people and
affairs.
</p>
<p>
It was their custom upon their return to their country house to invite a
few friends to a party to celebrate the occasion. Upon this occasion
Théophraste was at his best. He was in high spirits, and while passing the
good word to the gentlemen, made flattering speeches to the ladies. The
table was set in the garden under a tent where the guests assembled. After
a while the conversation turned to the latest doings in angling. M. Lopard
had caught a trout of three pounds; old M. Tartoush had cast his line on
Sunday-having caught nothing, complained that people made too much noise
shooting during the week, and drove the fish from these waters. All joined
in the conversation and gave their experiences except M. Théophraste.
</p>
<p>
He kept silent. He found the topic too commonplace and felt a desire to
raise its level. He wanted it to drift into some subject related to that
preoccupying his mind. After awhile he was able to get Adolphe interested
in the subject of ghosts. From ghosts the conversation led on to
spiritualism. One lady knew a somnambulist and related some strange
stories which were calculated to work upon the imagination of the company.
Adolphe, upon this, explained the spiritualistic point of view of the
phenomena of somnambulism, and cited well-known authorities. He seemed
quite in his element, and finally reached the point desired by
Théophraste, the transmigration of souls and reincarnation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; said Marceline, &ldquo;that a soul comes back to live in its
body? You have often told me so, Adolphe, but it seems to me that one&rsquo;s
reason strongly repulses such an hypothesis.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nothing is lost in Nature,&rdquo;
 replied Adolphe, positively. &ldquo;Neither the soul nor the body. All is
transformed, the soul as well as the body. The reincarnation of souls at
the end of a century is a doctrine which goes back to such great antiquity
that the ancient philosophers do not deny it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If one&rsquo;s soul returned to a body,&rdquo; said Marceline, &ldquo;one would surely know
it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; said Adolphe, &ldquo;but sometimes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah, sometimes?&rdquo; asked
Théophraste, who was by this time becoming intensely interested.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, there are cases. For instance: Ptolemy Caesar, son of Caesar and
Cleopatra, who was king of Egypt before Christ, remembered well to have
been Pythagoras, a Greek philosopher, who lived 600 years before.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; cried the ladies, and the gentlemen smiled skeptically.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You need not laugh, gentlemen. It is impossible to be more serious. Our
actual transformation, which is the final word in science, is in full
accord with the theory of reincarnation. What is transformation except the
idea that living things transform themselves, progressing one into
another? Nature presents herself to us under the aspect of a spark,
elaborately perfecting without ceasing to create, to attain an ideal which
will be the millennium. Whatever Nature does for the body she does for the
soul. It can be proved, for I have studied this side a great deal, and it
is the original of all sciences.
</p>
<p>
Monsieur Adolphe was not understood by the company, a fact of which he was
inwardly proud. He liked to feel a superiority of intellect, and often he
would raise the conversation above the level of his audience just to
gratify his vanity. He touched on many points which only need be referred
to lightly here in order to convince skeptics that the extraordinary
history of Théophraste is founded on a most scientific basis.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The transmigration of souls was taught in India,&rdquo; said Adolphe; &ldquo;the
cradle of the genus human, then in Egypt, then in Greece. They chanted its
mysteries in the name of Orpheus. Pythagoras, who continued the teaching,
did not admit with the philosophers on the banks of the Ganges that the
soul traveled over the cycle of all animal existence. He made it come
back, for example, into a pig.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There are some men,&rdquo; said Madame Beulie, &ldquo;who still have the souls of
pigs.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Without doubt,&rdquo; said Adolphe, smiling; &ldquo;but what Pythagoras says is that
we must not conclude from that, that pigs have the souls of men. Plato
also adopts this doctrine. It is the first which gave in the Phidon the
proof that souls do not exile themselves forever and that they come back
to animate bodies anew.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, if we could only get proof of that it would be nothing for me to
die,&rdquo; declared old Mlle. Tabouret, who had a mortal terror of dying.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here are the proofs,&rdquo; continued Adolphe. &ldquo;They are two in number. One is
taken from the general law of Nature, the other from human nature. First,
Nature is governed by the laws of contraries, and from that we see that
while death succeeds life, all would end by being absorbed in death, and
Nature would one day come to an end like Endymion. Therefore I say that we
exist after death.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Secondly, if after consulting the general laws of Nature we turn to our
own minds, we will find there the same dogma attested by the fact of
resemblance. &lsquo;To learn,&rsquo; said Plato, &lsquo;is nothing but to recollect. Since
our souls learn, they must have a resemblance. What does it recollect
except to have lived, and to have lived in another body? Why can we not
believe that in leaving the body while it is animate at this time it can
animate several others in succession?&rsquo; I quote Plato literally,&rdquo; remarked
Adolphe.
</p>
<p>
Then he passed from Plato to a modern authority. &ldquo;Charles Fournier has
said: &lsquo;Where is the old man who has not truly wished to be born again, and
to use in another life the experience he has acquired in this?&rsquo; To pretend
that that desire ought not to be realized is to admit that God can deceive
us. We ought then to recognize that we have lived previous to being what
we are, and that several other lives await us. All these lives, to the
number of eight hundred and ten, are distributed between five periods and
embrace a span of eighty-one thousand years. Allan Hardai reckons that the
soul returns to another body after two or three thousand years unless we
die a violent death. Then it is quite possible one can be reincarnated
after two hundred years.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Adolphe had by this time drawn all around him and became the center of
attraction by his entertaining remarks. Théophraste had sat open-eyed,
listening intently, and upon hearing the last remark thought &ldquo;That is
well. They may have hung me; so if I did not die that way, they may have
got rid of me by some other death more in keeping with my station in life.
Nevertheless,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;if all these people here could only realize
that they had a prince of the royal blood among them, they would be very
much astonished, and be filled with respect. But no, he will still be
Théophraste Longuet, manufacturer of rubber stamps.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Champagne was brought, and soon the air rang merrily with general chatter
and the explosion of corks. It was then that Marceline turned around to
Théophraste and begged him to sing the song which he was accustomed to
sing on the anniversary of their marriage. He had sung it the day of their
wedding, and on account of its beauty they had adopted it as their wedding
song. It was Lissette de Baranger.
</p>
<p>
However, to the consternation of Marceline and all the guests, instead of
singing the song, he rose, threw his napkin on the table and said to her
in that strange voice which they heard at the Conciergerie:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;As thou wishest, Marie Antoinette, I can refuse thee nothing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my God,&rdquo; cried Marceline. &ldquo;Hear what he called me in that strange
voice!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The guests were obviously uncomfortable, and did not know what to make of
his peculiar behavior. The song was a vulgar song of the Regency period,
and certainly not for such a gathering as was at this party. He sang it
with the old French air:
</p>
<p class="indent20">Tou joli belle mimiere&mdash;
</p>
<p class="indent20">Tou joli, moulin.

<h2>
CHAPTER V
</h2>
<h3>
<i>Théophraste Remembers Himself</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HEOPHRASTE sang the song in loud, strident tones, his eyes sparkling,
glass in hand. It was with indescribable surprise that the company
received it, and despite the richness of the rhyme, the couplet was
followed by no applause. An awkward silence followed, and all the ladies
looked to Marceline for an explanation.
</p>
<p>
What was it that Marceline could explain? Adolphe himself looked at
Théophraste in surprise; but Théophraste, as if possessed with the devil,
continued with the second couplet of the drinking song. When he had
finished, he sat down, looked around with satisfaction, and said to
Marceline, &ldquo;What do you think of that, Marie Antoinette?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In the midst of a death-like silence preserved by all, Marceline asked
tremblingly, &ldquo;Why do you call me Marie Antoinette?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Because you are the most beautiful of all!&rdquo; cried Théophraste. &ldquo;I appeal
to Madame la Marechale de Bouilleurs, who has taste. I appeal to all of
you. And there is not one who, by the signet of the Pope, will contradict
me, neither the Eros Picards, nor the Bourbons, nor the Burgundias, nor
the Provincials, nor the Poet St. Jack, nor Gatelard, nor Bras-de-Fer, nor
Guente Noir, not even Bal-a-voir.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
M. Théophraste had on his right old Mlle. Tabouret, and he pinched her
knee as he looked at Marceline, which nearly made that austere person
faint. No one dared to move; for the fiery look of Théophraste frightened
the whole company. He leaned amorously towards Mlle. Tabouret, and said to
her, staring at Marceline, who was by this time weeping: &ldquo;Let us see,
Mlle. Tabouret, am I not right? To whom can I compare her? Is it La Belle
Laitere, or La Petite Minion; or even La Blanche of the bowling alley; or
La Belle Helene, who kept the Harp Tavern?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Turning towards Adolphe, he said with great energy, &ldquo;Come you, Va-de-Bon
Cour, tell me your opinion. Look at Marie Antoinette a little while. By
the fatted calf, she puts them all in the shade: Jeannette, the flower
girl of the Royal Palace; Marie Leroy and the female Solomon, the beauty
of the Temple; Jeanne Bonnefoy, who kept the café of the Port Marie; Manon
de Versailles, the poultry girl-none of them approach her in beauty.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He then leapt with one bound upon the table, and breaking the dishes, cups
and plates into a thousand pieces, held his glass over his head and
shouted, &ldquo;Let us drink to the Queen of the Nymphs, Marie Antoinette.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Draining his glass, he smashed it against the table and waved his hand,
which was covered with blood. By this time the party had fled in terror,
fearing that some tragedy would follow Théophraste&rsquo;s strange behavior. On
superficially thinking of these curious actions one would immediately
conclude that he had gone mad or was drunk, but this was not the case.
There is another kind of sense beside common sense. It was not because he
was crazy or drunk that he could sing a song that he had never learnt,
speak a language that he had never heard, or refer to people that he had
never read about, who had been dead for centuries. There must have been
some other force working in his brain.
</p>
<p>
Modern scientific experiments have shown with indisputable examples that
this particular case was far from unique. Ignorant people, who neither
knew how to read or write, who had never been outside their village, have
been known to give most correct answers to the medium who questioned them
in a dead language. And this has been before professors of colleges, not
before charlatans. It is difficult to explain. It is the mystery of this
life, the life hereafter. Some say that it is a learned spirit talking
through these ignorant mouths, others have timidly expressed the opinion
that such phenomena can only be explained by the remembrance of a former
life. Therefore the things which Théophraste said and did without
understanding, the Other who relives in him at intervals understands
perfectly well, and if we would understand them we must know who this
Other is.
</p>
<p>
As to Théophraste, after the guests had disappeared from the tent, he
climbed down from the table. He found it more difficult to reach the floor
than it had been to climb upon the table, and he knelt down, taking great
precaution not to fall. He then assumed his natural self and called
Marceline. She did not answer him, and in searching for her he found her
trembling with fright in her room. He closed the door carefully and
prepared to give an explanation. She looked at him with her large eyes,
amazed, filled with tears, and he felt it his duty as a husband not to
conceal from her any longer this extraordinary phenomenon which had been
preoccupying his mind.
</p>
<p>
The night was ideal, and after they had retired he said to her, &ldquo;My dear
Marceline, you cannot understand what has happened to me this evening, and
I can assure you I don&rsquo;t understand myself, but in telling you all I know
perhaps we can arrive at some conclusion.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He then related all the details of his visits to the cellars of the
Conciergerie. He concealed nothing, and sketched in minute details the
extraordinary feelings which had actuated him that evening, and the
unknown influence which had commanded him. At first she said nothing, but
softly moved away from him as if afraid of him; but when he came to the
document which revealed the existence of the treasures, she demanded to
see it at once. He judged then that she was taking an interest in the
adventure and felt thankful. They got up and he showed her the paper in
the light of the full moon, which was streaming into the room. Like all
those who had seen it before, she recognized the handwriting immediately,
and made the sign of the cross as if fearing some sorcery. Marceline was
not a fool, but explained that she could not help making the sign.
However, she soon became composed, and began to praise Adolphe, who, in
spite of Théophraste&rsquo;s disapproval, had initiated her into the elements of
spiritualism, a science she said which would be of some service to
Théophraste in his condition. But even in the face of that uncontestable
evidence she found it difficult to believe that he was a reincarnated
spirit dating back two hundred years, until he asked her who she thought
he had been.
</p>
<p>
Marceline didn&rsquo;t think that he had been a very great personage, and in
reply to his disappointed inquiry she said:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Because this evening you sang in slang, and the ladies whose names you
mentioned do not belong to the aristocracy. People who frequented La
Terpidere, La Platire, Manon de Versailles, I think are not of much
account.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I also mentioned the leader of the Bouffleurs,&rdquo; replied Théophraste,
&ldquo;and you know that morals were so dissolute under the Regency of the Duke
of Orleans that the fashion at Court was to call the ladies in slighting
terms. What do you think of the idea of me being the Bastard of the
Regent?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
For sole response she embraced Théophraste in delight, and recollecting
his duty on this day of celebration proved to her that if he was more than
two hundred years old, his love always remained youthful.

CHAPTER VI

<h3>
<i>M. Lecamus Expresses His Views.</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>FTER a while Marceline was able to persuade Théophraste to confide in M.
Adolphe Lecamus. She declared that Adolphe&rsquo;s great experience, his certain
knowledge of the science of metaphysics, ought to be a great help to a man
who had buried treasures two hundred years before and wished to find them
again. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;it is he who will be able to reveal your
identity.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He yielded to her persuasions, and in the morning told Adolphe everything.
Adolphe was astonished, and it surprised Théophraste that a man who
professed Spiritualism should show so much emotion when face to face with
a reincarnated spirit. He said that Théophraste&rsquo;s conduct at the dinner
table the day before and the words he uttered to him before and since the
visit to the Conciergerie were well calculated to prepare him for such a
confidence, but he did not expect such a thing as this. He demanded to see
the proof of such a phenomenon. Théophraste readily showed the document,
and Adolphe could not deny the authenticity of it. He recognized the
handwriting at once, and exclaimed, upon examination, that the handwriting
explained many things to him. He had often thought how curiously the
characters in Théophraste&rsquo;s handwriting differed from his real character.
It had always been difficult for him to associate the handwriting with
Théophraste.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;what character do you ascribe to me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, if you will promise not to bear me any ill, I will tell you!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
On this assurance he painted Théophraste&rsquo;s character. It was that of a
kind citizen, an honest merchant, an excellent husband, but a man
incapable of showing any firmness, wit or energy. He told him also that
his timidity was excessive, and that kindness was always ready to
degenerate into weakness. The picture was not at all flattering, and
Théophraste felt a little hurt.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you have told me what you think of my character,
tell me what you think of my writing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Then he made observations on his handwriting which would not have failed
to make him quite angry if he had not remembered that Signor Petito had
said the same. He said:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your writing expresses all the contrary sentiments in your nature as I
know it, and I can imagine nothing more antithetical than your writing and
your real character. Thus you do not write a characteristic hand, but the
handwriting of the Other.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste was deeply interested. He thought of the strength and energy
of the Other, he imagined that he was a great captain. However, Adolphe&rsquo;s
next remark completely disillusioned him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Any sign in those formations, in the pointed fashion they have of
reuniting, and in the way of growing tall and of climbing up, and of
passing each other, show energy, firmness, obstinacy, ardor, activity, and
ambition, but all for evil.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This dismayed him, but he exclaimed with a show of spirit: &ldquo;Where is the
evil? Where is the good? If Attila had known how to write perhaps he would
have written like Napoleon.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They called Attila the scourge of God.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And Napoleon the scourge of man,&rdquo; replied Théophraste, with difficulty
controlling his anger.
</p>
<p>
How could it be that Théophraste Longuet could have been anything else but
an honest being before his birth, during his life, and after his death?
</p>
<p>
Marceline agreed with him, and Adolphe fearing that he had gone too far
made apologies.

CHAPTER VII
</h2>
<h3>
<i>Théophraste and His Black Plume</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>OR the next few days M. Lecamus and M.
</p>
<p>
Longuet occupied themselves with evidence of this phenomenon, and were
often seen together, conversing mysteriously, in the bar-rooms and about
town, about the treason of the first of April. They left the Villa Flots
d&rsquo;Azure to return to Paris, with the intention of searching the libraries.
They worked diligently for several days without any result, until M.
Longuet began to lose spirit. M. Lecamus was more patient.
</p>
<p>
One evening as they were walking towards the Rond Point, in the Champs
Elysees, he turned around and said, &ldquo;What can we do to find the
approximate place where the treasures are buried if you have not your
black plume?&rdquo; Théophraste and Marceline could not understand this, and
asked for an explanation. He commented:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have heard of the water witches who could discover water by the aid
of a wand, by a phenomenon which nobody has as yet been able to explain.
These witches traced water across the various beds of earth, and by
pointing the little rods, indicated where it was necessary to dig in order
to make a well. I do not despair of showing you, Théophraste, where your
treasures are buried. I will conduct you over the ground shown in the
document, and tell you where it is that you must dig to find your
treasure.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; interrupted Théophraste, &ldquo;but this does not explain to us what you
mean by &lsquo;the black plume.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am coming to that now. I am obliged to speak of Darwin. You will
understand directly. You know that Darwin devoted himself to several
celebrated experiments, of which the best known is that with pigeons.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Desirous of accounting for the phenomenon of heredity and the value that
he attached to it, he closely studied the breeding of pigeons, which is
sufficiently rapid to have enabled him to draw conclusions upon an
appreciable number of generations. At the end of the tenth generation he
found the same type of pigeon, with the same defects, the same qualities,
the same form, the same outline, and the same black plume there in the
same place where the first pigeon had a black feather. Very well! With
that I will prove to you that it is the same with souls as it is with
bodies.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;At the end of the tenth generation, we find the same soul, as far as it
exists, with the same defects, the same virtues, and, as it were, with the
original black feather. While giving you this illustration, it is
necessary to distinguish between the soul which reappears thus
hereditarily, and that which comes back by reincarnation. Believing that
it is the result of a unique combination which nothing can oppose, and,
since it dwells in a case called a body, is hereditary in the same degree
as that body, an hereditary soul which comes from an ancestor always has
his black feather, while a soul which comes back by reincarnation finds
itself in a body which is in no way prepared to receive it. The aggregate
materials of this body are original, and decaying, momentarily impose a
silence on that soul.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But a time comes when this soul becomes the strongest, when it speaks,
when it shows itself entirely, just as the black feather does.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now, Théophraste, for several generations you were the honest gardeners
in the Ferte-sous-Jonarre. But when that soul speaks in you, you are no
longer yourself. Théophraste Longuet has disappeared. It is the Other who
is there. It is the Other who has the gesture, the manner, the action, the
black feather. It is the other who recalls the mystery of the treasure, it
is the Other who remembers the Other.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! This is admirable!&rdquo; exclaimed Théophraste, who was so deeply moved
that he could hardly refrain from weeping with excitement. &ldquo;And now I
understand what you mean by my black feather. My black feather returns to
me when I am the Other.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And he will help you then, my friend,&rdquo; declared Adolphe with conviction.
&ldquo;But until we have released the unknown who is hidden in Théophraste
Longuet, and until he lives with sufficient strength, audacity, and
liberty, until he is resuscitated, in a word, until he appears to us with
his &lsquo;black feather,&rsquo; we will confine ourselves to the study of that
interesting document which you brought from the Conciergerie. Let us make
a plan for penetrating the mystery. We will find out exactly where the
treasures are buried, but we must wait for the spirit who dwells in you to
say to us, &lsquo;It is there.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Marceline, overflowing with admiration, &ldquo;you talk like a
book, and I wonder that you have not more often tried to teach us these
things, for we are so ignorant. You must not leave a stone unturned to
find the treasure. I do not fear the destruction of the earth on account
of the object of our search.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Adolphe turned around to reprove Marceline for her flippancy, but at this
moment M. Milfroid, the Commissioner of Police, approached, and Adolphe
rose to greet his friend.
</p>
<p>
Adolphe introduced M. Milfroid to M. and Mme. Longuet. He was a man of
about forty years of age, elegantly dressed, immaculate gloves, a silvery
ringlet of hair on the white forehead. He advanced, smiling and bowing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We have often heard our friend M. Adolphe speak of you,&rdquo; said Marceline.
&ldquo;Your fame has gone before you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, madame, I have known you for a long time. Every time I meet M.
Lecamus he speaks to me of his friends of the Rue Gerauds, and in such
terms that it has been my greatest desire to have the happiness of being
presented to you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Marceline was conquered by such gallant manners. &ldquo;I hear that you play the
violin very well,&rdquo; she said.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am equally interested in philosophy,&rdquo; said M. Milfroid. &ldquo;An interest
which I owe to M. Adolphe, who is continually in dispute with me over the
immortality of the soul, and other psychic matters. He has really made a
convert of me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Théophraste, who had not yet taken part in the
conversation, &ldquo;Adolphe and I like to converse about serious matters, also.
We were just speaking of the relations between the soul and the body, and
the different ways that the soul has of behaving with the body.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said M. Milfroid, who desired to shine before Marceline, &ldquo;are you
able to distinguish between matter and mind, or the material and the
spiritual? Matter and mind are the same thing in the eyes of science. That
is to say, they constitute alike one unit, one force, produce at one time
the phenomenon of cause and effect, tending to one end, the progressive
steps of existence. You are the only ones, gentlemen, to still make that
old distinction between matter and mind.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
After a while they rose and returned through the Place de la Concorde. At
the entrance to the Rue Royale, there was a crowd of people, shouting and
gesticulating. Théophraste, an old Parisian, wanted to know what was
taking place, and flung himself into the crowd.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Look out for pickpockets,&rdquo; Marceline called to him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, madame,&rdquo; said Monsieur Milfroid, the Commissioner of Police, &ldquo;there
are no pickpockets when I am about.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is true. We should be in no danger when you are here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do not know about that,&rdquo; said Adolphe, looking about them. &ldquo;My friend
here appears more dangerous to me than all the pickpockets on earth.&rdquo; At
this they all laughed.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste made them wait ten minutes before he appeared, and then he
announced that it was a coachman who had gotten his wheels locked with an
automobile, and could not separate them.
</p>
<p>
Marceline felt annoyed at having been kept waiting so long on such a
slight pretext. However, her thoughts were diverted in doing the honors of
a hostess, and she invited M. Milfroid to dinner.
</p>
<p>
During the dinner many pleasantries were passed, and M. Milfroid excelled
in complimenting Marceline.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, he became uneasy, and plunging his hands in his pockets, looked
vainly for his handkerchief. After a final and useless search, he passed
his forefinger under his moustache, and sighed, declaring that it did not
matter.
</p>
<p>
However, at that moment Théophraste wiped his mouth, and Marceline asked
him where he had found such a beautiful handkerchief. M. Mil-froid at once
recognized it as his own, and thinking it just a piece of pleasantry, took
the handkerchief from Théophraste. However, feeling in his left side, he
became pale and exclaimed, &ldquo;Good God! I have lost my pocketbook. There
were five hundred francs in it.&rdquo; M. Milfroid did not regret losing the
five hundred francs, but he found himself ridiculed by Adolphe, and
Marceline teased him gently and laughed prettily. They were all poking fun
at him, and this made him furious.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;M. Milfroid,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;if you need any money for the evening I
can lend it to you,&rdquo; and he drew a wallet from his pocket. M. Milfroid
uttered a cry: it was his! M. Milfroid took the wallet from him as he had
done the handkerchief, and alleging numerous engagements, he took his
leave. Before going down the stairs, he said to his friend Adolphe, who
followed him, &ldquo;These are nice kind of people you have introduced me to.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
When Adolphe returned to the dining-room, Théophraste was emptying his
pockets. On the table there lay three watches, six handkerchiefs, several
pocketbooks, containing large sums of money, and eighteen checks.

CHAPTER VIII
</h2>
<h3>
<i>An Appeal for Help</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE important events of this story and its hero have occupied us to such
an extent that we have not found time to present Monsieur Lecamus as he
should be. The little that we know of him does not effect our sympathy.
The place that he occupies in the house of Longuet, which is eminently
immoral; the cynicism with which he deceives an innocent soul; the little
danger that he seems to run in accomplishing the larceny- these are good
reasons why we have deferred showing our contempt for him. It may be said
that we have judged hastily, and have not allowed him to plead extenuating
circumstances. The principal one, and the one which it would be well for
us to dwell upon, is that he really liked Théophraste above everybody
else. He loved him with his faults, his weaknesses, his ingenuousness, the
confidence he had in him, and above all, the admiration Théophraste had
for him. There was no sacrifice he would not make for Théophraste, and I
daresay that if Théophraste had any pecuniary troubles, which after all
are the only troubles which really count here below, Adolphe Lecamus would
open his purse, and give to him freely. Adolphe loved Théophraste even
above Marceline; and although I do not pretend to deal here with
psychology, I find myself confronted with a case which is much less common
than one would be inclined to believe. For Adolphe loved Marceline because
he had made her his mistress.
</p>
<p>
If he had learned, by some supernatural warning, that Théophraste would
some day learn his real position in the household, he would only have
respected Marceline. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;Théophraste will never
know anything about it, and as unknown evils do not exist, I will be the
lover of the wife of my best friend.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
These lines are necessary, that the reader may understand properly the
knavish tricks of the lover. But we must understand distinctly Adolphe&rsquo;s
devotion to Théophraste.
</p>
<p>
After the departure of the Commissioner, they all set themselves to
consider what was to be done with the articles which Théophraste had
brought home with him. At first they all sat silently looking at the
objects, no one wishing to break the silence, until Théophraste said, &ldquo;I
have nothing more in my pockets. I really believe I have got my black
plume.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Marceline and Adolphe were startled by this, but still did not say
anything, and waited for Théophraste to give some explanation. Then he
declared it was in the crowd at the Place de la Concorde. He went in and
out among the crowd, and it was a very simple matter for him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What must we do?&rdquo; asked Adolphe in a grave voice?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you wish me to do?&rdquo; replied Théophraste, who by this time had
begun to confess. &ldquo;You do not think that I am going to keep them! It is
not my habit to keep things that do not belong to me. I am an honest man
and have never wronged anybody. You must take them all to M. Milfroid,
your friend, the Commissioner of Police. He can easily restore them to the
owners.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What can I say to him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Whatever you wish,&rdquo; burst out Théophraste, who was becoming impatient.
&ldquo;Did the honest coachman who found a purse and fifty thousand francs in
his carriage think about what he should say when he took them to the
commissariat? He simply said, &lsquo;I have found them in the carriage.&rsquo; That
was sufficient. They even rewarded him for it. You must say, &lsquo;My friend
Longuet charged me to bring this to you. He found them in his pockets, and
he does not wish a reward.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Marceline touched Adolphe with her foot under the table. This was her
customary way of secretly drawing Adolphe&rsquo;s attention. She wanted to
signify to him that she thought Théophraste was demented, and her look
quite showed it. Adolphe understood. He knitted his brows and scratched
the tip of his nose. He felt that now was the time to act. He looked from
Théophraste to the pocket-books, and coughing, said, &ldquo;Théophraste, this is
not natural. We have to explain ourselves. We must understand. You must
not close your eyes to this misfortune. You must open them wide, and bring
your will to fight it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of what misfortune are you speaking?&rdquo; asked Théophraste, becoming
frightened.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, is it not a misfortune to have things in your pocket that do not
belong to you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do not understand. You seem to be accusing me of being dishonest. I am
an honest man, and whatever I have done dishonestly, I have done against
my will.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Having said these words, he fell back in his chair in a dead faint, and a
deep silence fell over them all.
</p>
<p>
When Théophraste came out of his stupor, his eyes were full of tears. He
motioned to his wife and his friend to come nearer to him. When they were
beside him, he said, showing pitiable emotion, &ldquo;I feel that Adolphe is
right. A great misfortune menaces me, I know not what! I know not what! My
God! I know not what! I know not what!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Adolphe and Marceline attempted to console him, but he wept more. Then
Marceline began to weep.
</p>
<p>
In his emotion, Théophraste grasped them both by the hand, and cried,
&ldquo;Swear never to abandon me, no matter what happens, for, oh! some day I
shall need your help.&rdquo; They swore to him in good faith.
</p>
<p>
Adolphe then asked to see the document. As he spread the document before
him, he said, &ldquo;Théophraste, tell me, do you ever have dreams?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is very probable, but I only dream a very little.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never?&rdquo; insisted Adolphe.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Scarcely ever. However, I remember to have dreamed four or five times in
my life, perhaps because I woke each time in the middle of my dream, and
it was always the same dream. But what possible interest can there be in
this, to the subject which is occupying us now, Adolphe?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Adolphe continued: &ldquo;Dreams have never been explained by science. Science
attributes them all to the effects of the imagination, but it does not
give us the reason for these clear, distinct visions which appear to us
sometimes. Thus it explains a thing which is not known by another which is
no better understood. It says that dreams are the recollection of things
which took place in a former life. But even admitting this solution-which
is a doubtful one-we still have to find out what is the magic mirror that
serves so well to keep the imprint of things. Moreover, how can one
explain visions of real things, events that one has never seen in a former
state, and of which one has never even thought? Who can affirm that these
are not visions of retrospective past events in a former life?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is right, my dear Adolphe,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;and I ought to
confess the things that I have dreamed. I have dreamed them three times as
I said before, things that were perhaps true in the past, or will be in
the future. I have never seen them in a waking state in my present life.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You understand me,&rdquo; said Adolphe. &ldquo;Relate to me the things that you have
dreamed of and have never seen.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that will not take long. But so much the better, for it is not very
cheerful: I dreamed that I was married to a woman named Marie Antoinette,
and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; interrupted Adolphe, who had never taken his eyes off the
document.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And then I cut her up in pieces.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, horrors!&rdquo; cried Marceline.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is horrible,&rdquo; continued Théophraste, shaking his head. &ldquo;Then I put the
pieces in a basket and threw them into the Seine by the little bridge of
the Hotel Dieu. I awoke then, and you may be sure I was not sorry.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Adolphe struck the table a hard blow with his fist. &ldquo;It is frightful,&rdquo; he
cried in a harsh voice, looking at Théophraste.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is it not?&rdquo; said Marceline, shuddering.
</p>
<p>
Adolphe read the first lines of the document.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, how dreadful it is!&rdquo; he continued, groaning. &ldquo;Alas, alas! I
understand all, now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you understand?&rdquo; asked Théophraste in a frightened voice,
following Adolphe&rsquo;s finger as he traced the first two lines of the
document.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Adolphe. &ldquo;&lsquo;Moi et! I buried my, treasures.&rsquo; And you do not
know what that &lsquo;et&rsquo; means? Well, I won&rsquo;t tell you until I am quite sure. I
will know to-morrow. Théophraste, tomorrow at two o&rsquo;clock be at the Rue
Guinegaud and the Rue Mazarin. I am going to take these articles to M.
Milfroid&rsquo;s house. He will restore them to their owners, and we will prove
to him that there are pickpockets even when the Commissioner is present.
Adieu, my friend, adieu. Above all take courage. Take courage.&rdquo; Adolphe
shook Théophraste&rsquo;s hand with the warmth of a comrade, and departed.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste did not sleep that night. While Marceline reposed peacefully
by his side, he lay with eyes wide open in the darkness. His respiration
was irregular, and he sighed often. Anxiety lay heavy upon him.

CHAPTER IX
</h2>
<h3>
<i>The Portrait</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>AY broke over the city. A cloudy day, with a mist that enveloped
everything in a sinister manner. The sun tried in vain to penetrate that
sombre atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
Mid-day showed a dark red ball, rolling ingloriously in a sulphurous
light. Such was the picture of the heavens that day.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste sprang out of bed early, and awoke Marceline suddenly by an
excess of foolish hilarity. Marceline inquired the reason for such strange
joyfulness. He said that he could not help laughing at the idea of M.
Milfroid, the Commissioner of Police, receiving back the stolen goods
which had been pickpocketed right before his very eyes. &ldquo;My dear
Marceline,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is foolish, the way people carry the money in
their pockets. If you cannot put your hand in, slip a straw, filled with
glue, in. It is an excellent scheme for extricating money from people&rsquo;s
pockets.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Marceline sat up and gazed at him. She could not understand, as he never
looked more natural in his life, and yet he was saying peculiar things,
and his words were most unnatural.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Théophraste, you frighten me,&rdquo; she cried, and in her fear, groaned, &ldquo;My
poor child.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste grew terribly angry. He threw himself at his wife, and
threatened to strike her. &ldquo;You know perfectly well that I do not wish to
be called a child since the death of Jeanneton-Venes. I am no child.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Marceline swore that she would never do it again, and in the depths of her
soul regretted the unlucky moment which had given her husband
proprietorship of a document which had brought into the household such
fears and such follies. She knew neither Marie Antoinette, nor
Jeanneton-Venes, although he continually referred to them. He had a
familiar way of expressing himself about these women which made her
uneasy, and finally the unexpected sentences, spoken by Théophraste, and
his actions, made her dread the incomprehensible Théophraste of two
hundred years ago. It made her long for the former Théophraste, so kind,
so easy to understand. Then she gave herself up to bitter reflections upon
the theory of reincarnation.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste finished dressing, and then announcing that he would not
breakfast at home, said that he had a rendezvous with his friend Va-de-Bon
Cour, at the corner of the Rue Mazarin and Rue Guinegaud, to do a good
turn for M. de Francouse, but as that rendezvous was after breakfast, he
intended enjoying the air in the Moulin de Chopinette.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You will leave my green umbrella here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I will take my
black feather.&rdquo; Then, putting the final touches to his cravat, he went
out. On the landing he met Signor Petito, the Italian professor, who was
also going downstairs. Signor Petito bowed very low, complained of the
state of the weather, and complimented Théophraste on his appearance.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste answered in a less amiable tone, as he was not desiring the
Signor&rsquo;s company, and he demanded of him if Madame Petito could not be
induced to learn another air on the piano than &ldquo;Carnival de Venice.&rdquo; But
Signor Petito replied, smiling, that she was already studying &ldquo;Love&rsquo;s
Destiny,&rdquo; but in future she would study only the pieces which would please
M. Longuet. He then asked, &ldquo;Which way are you going?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;For a turn in the Moulin de Chopinette; but the weather is too bad, so I
will have to go down to the Porcherons.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To the Porcherons?&rdquo; Signor Petito was going to ask, but he changed his
mind. &ldquo;Where is the Porcherons?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I will go, too.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Aha, indeed!&rdquo; said M. Longuet, glancing curiously at Signor Petito. &ldquo;You
too will go to the Porcherons?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Go there or somewhere else,&rdquo; said Signor Petito, pleasantly, and he
followed Théophraste.
</p>
<p>
At the end of a short silence Signor Petito ventured to ask, &ldquo;Where are
your treasures, M. Longuet?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste faced about suddenly. &ldquo;What has put such an idea into your
head?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you not remember the day that you brought the specimen of your
handwriting and asked for my opinion?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I remember, and you were wrong,&rdquo; said Théophraste drily, as he opened his
umbrella.
</p>
<p>
Signor Petito, in nowise discouraged, placed himself under the shelter of
Théophraste&rsquo;s umbrella. &ldquo;Oh! M. Longuet, I did not say that to annoy you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
They arrived at the corner of the Avenue Tre-daine. Théophraste was in
very bad humor.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have an appointment at the tavern of the
Veau-qui-telle, by the side of the Chapel Porcherons, here, you see.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But we are at the Chapel Notre Dame de Lor-rete, and not the Porcherons,
at all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste disregarded Petito&rsquo;s remark, and suddenly said to him, &ldquo;Do you
know that there is a price on my head?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Signor Petito seemed taken aback by this sudden change of tone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It will cost them dear, though, to get my head,&rdquo; said Théophraste. &ldquo;Do
you know how much it will cost, Signor, the head of L&rsquo;Enfant? No? Very
well. I am going to tell you, since the occasion has presented itself, and
I am going to tell you the whole story, which may be profitable to you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Then, without any preparation, he related in the most natural way
possible, his existence previous to his present one.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My head is worth 20,000 pounds,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and you know it very well.&rdquo;
 And as he pronounced these words he struck the table such a blow that
Signor Petito recoiled instinctively.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here is the history of it all. I was walking, two hundred years ago, in
the Rue de Vauregard, with my hands in my pocket, without arms, without
even a sword, with the most honest intentions in the world, when a man met
me. He bowed almost to the ground, and told me that my face reminded him
so much of some one he knew. He was called &lsquo;Old Man Bidel,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Bidel the
Good-natured,&rsquo; and he said that he had a secret to confide to me.
</p>
<p>
I encouraged him by a friendly tap on the shoulder, and he confided his
secret to me. He whispered in my ear that the Regent had promised twenty
thousand pounds to whoever would arrest the Enfant, and he knew where the
Enfant was hiding. That I looked to him like a man of courage, and that
he, with my aid, would do anything to get the 20,000 pounds. He said that
he would divide the reward.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The old man Bidel was on the wrong track, Signor Petito, for I also knew
where to find L&rsquo;Enfant, seeing that I was that person.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Signor Petito did not wish to believe any of this, as he could see for
himself that M. Longuet had been out of infancy a good many years.
However, he dared not say anything. Théophraste continued, &ldquo;I replied to
the old man Bidel, that it was a happy chance and that I thanked Heaven
for putting him in my path, and I made him conduct me to the place where
he could find the Enfaut. He said to me, &lsquo;To-night, the Enfant sleeps at
the Capucine, in the Tavern Suite, which bears as a sign the Cross of the
St. Hester.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was true, Signor Petito, the old man Bidel was very well informed. I
congratulated him, and we passed just then a cutlery shop, and I bought a
small knife, much to the astonishment of Bidel, who asked me what I
planned to do with such a weapon. I replied to him that with a small knife
like this one could kill a fly, and I plunged it into his heart. He sank
down, raised his arms wildly for a few moments, and died.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Signor Petito, who at first had moved away from Théophraste, now rose and
ran to the door, and was glad to get out of sight.
</p>
<p>
M. Longuet drank his wine, got up and went to the Bousset Brewery, where
Mme. Barth was standing, making up her books. He said to her, &ldquo;Mme.
Taconet&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mme. Barth demanded why he called her Mine. Taconet, but he disregarded
her question, and continued, &ldquo;If Signor Petito comes here again, you will
tell him for me that the first time I find him in my way, I will cut his
ears off.&rdquo; Saying this, Théophraste fondled the handle of his umbrella as
one grasps the handle of a dagger.
</p>
<p>
There was no doubt about it, he had his black plume. He had become the
Other entirely.
</p>
<p>
The fog was still thick and he did not think of breakfasting yet. He
walked into the sulphurous mist like one in a dream. He crossed the whole
of the Quarter of An tin, and that which was formerly the Avenue
L&rsquo;Enrique, until he came under the shadows of the towers of Trinity, which
he called the Chateau du Coq. On his arrival at the St. Lazare, he
believed that he was at the Petite Pologue.
</p>
<p>
But little by little the fog cleared away, and his dream disappeared with
it. He had the most exact idea of things when he crossed the Point Royale,
and by the time he had set foot on the left bank, he was again the honest
Théophraste, and had only the vaguest idea of that which had happened on
the right bank. But he could remember this, and when he questioned himself
thoroughly, he began to experience the different conditions or states of
the soul. He discovered in himself three distinct states. First, that
which resulted from his life as an actuality, the honest merchant; second,
that which resulted from the sudden and momentary resurrection of the
Other; and third, that which resulted from memory. The recollection was to
him like a third Théophraste, who related to the first what he had known
of the second. This resurrection of Théophraste&rsquo;s was a terrible thing.
</p>
<p>
On crossing the Bridge he hurried beyond the Rue Guinegaud. He did not
care to pass by the corner of the Rue Mazarin, he knew not why. He turned
the corner by the Hotel Monniare, and almost ran into Adolphe, who was
waiting for him there.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you ever heard of a person called L&rsquo;Enfant, my dear Adolphe?&rdquo; he
asked.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes,&rdquo; said Aldolphe, &ldquo;I have heard of him. I even know his real
name, his family name.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, what is it?&rdquo; anxiously inquired Théophraste.
</p>
<p>
Adolphe for reply pushed Théophraste into the hallway of an old house, in
the Rue Guinegard, a few steps from the Hotel de la Monniare. They climbed
a tottering staircase, and entered a room in which the curtains were
drawn. Somebody had spent the night in the room.
</p>
<p>
On a little table in the corner, the trembling flame of a wax candle lit
up a portrait. It was the picture of a man about thirty years of age. He
had a robust figure, high forehead, strong nose, a smooth chin, and large
mouth and moustache. His thick hair was covered by a coarse woolen cap,
and he wore a coat over a coarse linen shirt, which appeared to be a
prison garb.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Théophraste, without raising his tone, &ldquo;how is it that my
portrait is in this house?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your picture?&rdquo; asked Adolphe. &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who could be more sure of it than I?&rdquo; said Théophraste again, without
being excited.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said M. Lecamus, with emotions that it would be hard to
describe. &ldquo;That portrait, which is your portrait, is the portrait of
Cartouche.&rdquo; When M. Lecamus turned to see the effect his words would
produce on his friend, he saw Théophraste stretched on the floor in a dead
swoon.
</p>
<p>
For a long time he worked to bring him to. He blew out the candle and
opened the windows, allowing the good air to come in. Théophraste came to
himself, and his first words were, &ldquo;Adolphe, above all things do not speak
of this to my wife.&rdquo;

<h3>
<i>Cartouche&rsquo;s Past</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE following day Théophraste and Marceline returned to the quiet life of
the Villa Flots-d&rsquo;Azure. Théophraste had not mentioned a word of the
discovery, and his wife refrained from questioning him. Marceline knew
nothing yet of the terrible discovery. Théophraste&rsquo;s face was full of
consternation, and it was evident to Marceline that he had terrible things
on his mind.
</p>
<p>
Adolphe was to join them in a few days; two days passed very quietly in
the villa. Marceline attended to her household duties, and Théophraste
silently prepared his fishing tackle, as he had promised Adolphe a few
days&rsquo; fishing in the Marne. On the third day, Théophraste, who had passed
a good night, showed a less agitated countenance, and began to smile and
was cheered at the prospect of Adolphe&rsquo;s coming. M. Lecamus arrived before
noon, and they both received him with delight.
</p>
<p>
Taking their places at lunch their conversation turned on angling, but
nothing was said of the mysterious proceedings of the week before. After
lunch they prepared for their fishing expedition; Théophraste took care of
the lines, the rods and the bait, and Adolphe took the nets.
</p>
<p>
Going down to the water&rsquo;s edge, Théophraste turned to Adolphe and said,
&ldquo;Tell me, have you any news? While we are fishing I will listen to you. I
have prepared a lot of sport, but I don&rsquo;t think we will do very much
to-day, if you have important news for me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Adolphe replied, &ldquo;There is some good, and some bad news. But I must tell
you that there is more bad than good. No doubt many stories have been
invented about you, but the real truth is not entirely pleasant.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you well informed, and is your information authentic?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have been to the very fountain-head, I have seen the authentic
documents. I am going to tell you what I know. If I am mistaken, correct
me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste threw his half-prepared bait into the water, and said, &ldquo;Go on.
I must have a full explanation.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;First,&rdquo; said Adolphe, &ldquo;you were born in the month of October, 1693. You
were called Louis Dominique Cartouche.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But it is needless to call me Cartouche, no one need know that. Call me
L&rsquo;Enfant. I like it much better and no one will understand.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; insisted Adolphe, &ldquo;but you know that your name is Cartouche. It is
not an assumed name. It is said that you studied hard in Clermont College.
That you were the schoolfellow of Voltaire, and there is a legend that
while you learned to read, in the course of time, thanks to the gypsies
who taught you reading, you were never able to write.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; cried Théophraste, &ldquo;for if I never learned to write,
how could I have drawn up the document in the dungeon of the
Conciergerie?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;At the time of your trial, you declared that you did not know how to
write. You signed your depositions with a cross and you have never written
a line to show who it was.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Théophraste said, &ldquo;it was never necessary to write. In my position
I should have dreaded to compromise myself. But the document is there.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Evidently. Let us return to your eleventh year. One day you were in the
Saint Laurent Faire, with some comrades, when you fell in with a band of
gypsies. The gypsies carried you away. They stole you. They taught you the
play of the cudgel, the sword, to shoot a pistol, to jump, and to rob the
pockets of the bourgeoisie without being discovered. At your twelfth year
you were an adept at this, and without an equal for bringing back
handkerchiefs, snuff boxes, and watches. The band of gypsies found
themselves at Rouen, when little Louis Dominique fell ill. He was taken to
a hospital in Rouen, and it was there that an uncle discovered him. He
recognized him, and swore to restore him to his parents.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Here Théophraste interrupted with a word as to his uncle, and Lecamus
becoming impatient, begged him to cease his continual interruptions,
declaring it would take some time to tell the story of Cartouche if he
would not listen to it silently.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I would like to see you in my place,&rdquo; said Théophraste.
</p>
<p>
Adolphe continued: &ldquo;In a while Cartouche became the chief of a band of
brigands. He commanded about three thousand men, had more than fifty
lieutenants; it was their habit to dress exactly alike, in
cinnamon-colored coats, and doublets of silk and amaranthine, showing a
piece of black taffeta underneath the left eye. They brought against him
more than one hundred and fifty personal assassinations, and put a price
upon his head. He was tried and broken on the wheel.&rdquo; &ldquo;Upon hearing this
Théophraste showed evident signs of alarm. He dropped his fishing tackle,
losing it in the swift current of the river. He could not give his mind to
fishing any more that day, and so they resolved to give up the attempt.
They did not wait for sundown, to return to the Villa Flots-d&rsquo;Azure.
Swinging their meagre spoils lightly in their nets they sadly retraced
their steps. Cartouche filled their minds, and their return journey was
occupied in thoughts of this dual personality.

CHAPTER XI
</h2>
<h3>
<i>Signor Petito Appears</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HILE waiting for the stage from Crecy to stop for them, they called at
the wayside inn, and had some refreshment, while Adolphe took up the story
of L&rsquo;Enfant at the point where he had left off.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That good uncle,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;had fellow-feeling for one of his family, and
he rescued young Cartouche from his miserable lot and made him return to
his parents. His father was a cooper by trade, and young Louis, having
profited by his youthful misfortunes, swore that henceforth he would be a
good son and a diligent apprentice. He helped his father to make casks,
working from daybreak to sunset.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He was frequently seen, during lunch hour, amusing his companions with
pretty tricks of sleight-of-hand which he had learned during the few
months he had been with the gypsies. He had become so adept at this
science that on special occasions little Louis and his family were invited
to dinners and suppers before friends, for they looked forward to the
enjoyment of these tricks of Louis&rsquo;, and he became a great success in the
quarter, and he, on his part, was proud of his growing renown.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;In the meantime he had attained that happy period where the least
sensitive of human beings feel the beating of their hearts awaken to the
most tender sentiments. Louis Dominique was in love. The object of his
affections was a charming needlewoman of the Rue Porte Foin, coquettish,
with blue eyes, golden hair, and a fine figure. I have said that this
needlewoman was a coquette. She loved dress, jewels and laces, and it was
her desire always to be better clothed than her companions. The modest
income of Louis Dominique did not permit of his paying for the extravagant
fancies of his poor seamstress, and so Cartouche stole from his father.
The latter soon found out and took steps by which he could have his boy
placed in the Convent of the Lazaretto, in the Faubourg St. Denis.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;instead of combating with kindness the wickedness
of this child, they drive him to despair by incarcerating him where he
only meets with bad examples, and where the feeling of revolt increases,
and boils over, stifling all other feelings in his inexperienced mind. I
wager that if they had not put Louis in the House of Correction, that all
the trouble would never have happened.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Reassure yourself,&rdquo; said Adolphe. &ldquo;Cartouche was never shut up in the
Convent of the Lazaretto, for while his father had discovered this crime
of Louis&rsquo;, he did not tell him of it; but one Sunday morning, he asked his
son to take a walk with him. Dominique readily acquiesced, and they were
soon seen walking down the street together.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Where are we going, father?&rsquo; asked Louis. &lsquo;No matter where. By way of
the Faubourg St. Denis.&rsquo; Louis pricked up his ears. He knew that at the
end of the Faubourg St. Denis was the Lazaretto, and he also knew that
sometimes fathers escorted their boys to the Lazaretto.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He at once felt suspicious, for his conscience was not altogether
tranquil, and when they arrived at the corner of the Faubourg St. Denis,
and the battlement of the St. Lazaretto rose before them, it seemed to him
that his father looked unnatural, and he felt uncomfortable at once. He
told his father to continue his walk, slowly, without hurrying, as he
wished to stop at the corner.
</p>
<p>
When his father returned, the son had disappeared, and he never saw him
again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
About this time the coach had arrived, and Adolphe discontinued his tale
while they mounted to the top. Théophraste recognized M. Bache, and Mme.
Froude, and he at once bowed to them, but they did not respond. He called
them by name, but they remained mute. Théophraste could not understand
this, and turned to ask Adolphe what he thought of it, and why they did
not recognize him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That does not astonish me at all,&rdquo; said Adolphe. &ldquo;It is no wonder to me,
since the dinner the other day, that nobody bows to you. Your
extraordinary behavior was enough to upset them all. Do you not remember
how you were mounted on the table and sang that vulgar song? There were
some young ladies present, Miles. Froude and Tabouret.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;that accounts for Mme. Bache&rsquo;s pretending not to
see me the other day in Paris, when she called at the Pharmacy Crecy and I
happened to meet her there. Never mind, Adolphe, continue where you left
off about my father. What happened to him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, you forgot about your seamstress at the Rue Point Foin, and you
thought of her no more.
</p>
<p>
She worried over your disappearance about a fortnight, and then got
somebody else, as is done under similar circumstances to-day. The
necessity to make your way in the world recalled your old talents, and
soon you were robbing passers-by of the things in their pockets. You
operated so adroitly, that you incurred the admiration of a great sharper,
who having seen you work, stopped you at the corner of the Rue Gallaud,
and demanded of you your money or your life. &lsquo;You shall have my purse only
when you have my life,&rsquo; said you to him, and you drew your sword, a small
sword that you had taken the day before from a French Guardsman. The great
sharper flattered you upon your courage, and then upon your dexterity, and
he begged you to accompany him home to the Rue Bout du Monde. He told you
on the way that he sought an associate, and you could do the business. He
also told you that he had a wife, and the wife had a very pretty sister.
After a while you married this sister, though neither notary nor priest
was sent for. The attachment did not last over six months, because the
sharper, his wife, and his sister-in-law were sent to the gallows. You had
already left them by this time, and had joined the army. You were caught
one day, drunk, by a recruiting officer, and he took you to the barracks,
and made you sign on.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
By this time it was seven o&rsquo;clock, and Adolphe interrupted the course of
his recital at that point, as they had to alight from the coach.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;I am curious to know how I was built. Was I
a handsome man, a tall man?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They represent you thus at the theater, in M. d&rsquo;Ennury&rsquo;s play, but on the
contrary, according to the poet Granvel, you were a conceited man, and
always fond of singing your own praises. You were dark, lean, small, but
of great courage. You were enterprising and bold, and very alert.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have not told me,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;how you got that picture in the
house on the Rue Guinegaud.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is a copy of a photograph by Nedar. He photographed a wax mask, which
ought to resemble you, as that mask was made from your face by the order
of the Regent. Nedar photographed that mask in 1859. The mask was found in
the Chateau de St. Germain.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! I want to see it,&rdquo; cried Théophraste-&ldquo;to touch it. We must go to St.
Germain to-morrow.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
By this time they had reached the house, and Marceline, in neat
dishabille, smilingly opened the door and greeted them.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste had a great desire to see and touch that waxen mask that had
been made from his face, and the desire was still greater when Adolphe
entered into the details of it. He told him that it had been in the
Chateau de St. Germain en Laye, since the 24th of April, 1849.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It appears that the portrait was given by an abbot, one Viallier, to be
inherited by one Richot, an old officer of the Hussars of King Louis XVI.
M. Richot died at St. Germain. He owned the portrait for many years, one
most precious, especially as it had belonged to the royal family. The wax
mask was moulded by a Florentine artist some days before Cartouche&rsquo;s
punishment. The head-dress was a woolen or coarse felt cap, his clothing
was a shirt of very coarse linen, a waistcoat, and another vest, and a
doublet of black camelot. But the most remarkable thing of all was that
Cartouche&rsquo;s hair was cut off of his corpse and pasted on the waxen mask.
The whole was shut up in a gilded wooden chest, large and deep, of
beautiful workmanship. A Venetian glass protected the portrait, and one
could still see the escutcheon of the arms of France on the chest.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste asked Adolphe where he had found such precise details, and was
told that they were the result of two days&rsquo; searching in the forgotten
archives of the most noted libraries and museums of Paris. There he found
his hair, his moustache, and his clothes, two hundred years old.
</p>
<p>
In spite of the horror which these relics of a man so monstrous ought to
have inspired in him, Théophraste could not control his impatience to see
them, to touch them. Here was Théophraste Longuet, whose name was
synonymous with honor, who had always feared the shedding of blood,
cherishing in his heart the coarse remains of the greatest brigand on
earth. When he had again command of his senses, he did not find in the
bottom of his soul a feeling of absolute despair, but of great pity, a
pity so keenly felt that he did not weep only for himself, Théophraste,
but also moved him to pity Cartouche. He asked himself which was the more
dominant, honest Théophraste, carrying with him the brigand Cartouche, or
the brigand Cartouche, shut up within honest Théophraste. &ldquo;It is necessary
that we should understand each other,&rdquo; he said aloud. He felt that he
should not have uttered that sentence which must have seemed odd, but
which expressed so well the double and yet unique preoccupation of his
soul that he could not restrain himself. A great light dawned upon him at
the same time, that recalled the theory of reincarnation that had been
explained to him by M. Lecamus. He connected reincarnation with the
natural evolution of things, and of individuals, that which was no other
than transformation. &ldquo;Does it not point to the fact that souls reincarnate
themselves in order to pass according to natural law to advancement to a
better state? It is the progressive step of being. Well, the natural law
which certain persons call God, did not find anything better on the earth
than the body of Théophraste Longuet through which to make the criminal
soul of Cartouche evolve to a better state.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
When that idea got a firm hold on him, in place of the deepest despair,
which had led him to faint, he found himself prompted by a sentiment
almost akin to pride. He was entrusted with the destiny of the world. He,
the humble but honest Théophraste, entrusted with the regeneration in
ideal splendor, of the soul of shadows and of the bloody Louis Dominique
Cartouche, called L&rsquo;Enfant. He accepted this unexpected task willingly,
since he could not do otherwise, and he put himself at once on his guard.
Instead of saying, &ldquo;It is necessary for us to understand each other,&rdquo; he
immediately ordered Cartouche to obey Théophraste, and he promised himself
to lead him a life so hard that he could not say without smiling, &ldquo;Poor
Cartouche.&rdquo; He had charged M. Lecamus to write everything possible about
Louis Dominique Cartouche in such a way that he could not be ignorant of
anything that could be known of his life. With that and with what his
black feather and his memory had taught him, he justly thought he could
resist in spirit the Other One, which would allow him to act accordingly.
He partly confided his reflections to Adolphe, who approved of them, but
warned him against a tendency he had to separate Théophraste from
Cartouche.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You must not forget,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that they are one. You have the instincts
of the gardeners of the Ferte-sous-Jonarre. Those instincts are good, but
you have the soul of Cartouche, which is detestable. Take care. You are
his declared enemy, the question is raised as to who will vanquish- the
soul of former years, or the instincts of today.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste asked Adolphe if the soul of Cartouche was really altogether
detestable, and was happy to learn that it had some good points. Adolphe
said that Cartouche had expressly forbidden to kill or even wound
passers-by without cause. When he operated in Paris with some of his
bands, and they brought victims to him, he spoke to them with so much
politeness and kindness, that they always returned a part of the booty to
him. Sometimes they would limit matters to a simple exchange of clothes.
When he found letters or pictures in the pockets of the coats thus
exchanged, he ran after the ex-proprietors to return them. It was a maxim
of that extraordinary individual, that a man ought not to be robbed twice
in the same night, nor were they to be too severely treated, so as not to
prevent the Parisians from going out in the evening. Therefore he ordered
his men to take the utmost care not to kill any one without good reason.
At this time the man was not yet thoroughly wicked. Up to then he had
always had a reason for every act. It is to be regretted, however, that he
had had one hundred and fifty reasons to assassinate.
</p>
<p>
Let us return to the wax mask.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste and Adolphe were going down the stairs in the station of St.
Germain-en-Laye, when suddenly Théophraste thought he saw a familiar
figure ahead of him, among a group of travelers. Moved by a feeling over
which he had no control, he ran rapidly towards the group, but the figure
had disappeared. Where had he seen that figure before? It was so repulsive
to him. Adolphe asked him the cause of his agitation, and he recovered
himself at once.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I would swear,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;that it was Signor Petito, the Italian
professor of the floor below. What did Signor Petito come to St. Germain
for? I do not want to run foul of him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, what has he done, then?&rdquo; asked Adolphe.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, nothing. Only if he runs across my way, I swear I will cut off his
ears, and you know I will do it if I say so.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
They then went, without any more thought of Signor Petito, to the castle.
They entered the Museum, and asked to see the wax mask of Cartouche.
Théophraste became enraged when he learned that it was not to be found
there, and in his excitement he poked the handle of his green umbrella
into the eye of a plaster cast of a member of the Legion of Honor. An old
guard came up and told him that he knew well there had been a wax mask of
Cartouche in St. Germain, and that it could be found, he thought, in the
library. But the latter had been closed up for eight days for repairs.
Théophraste gave that man a franc, and they turned their steps toward the
terrace, promising themselves to come again at a later time, for the
farther the wax mask seemed away, the more Théophraste burned to touch it.
</p>
<p>
It was a beautiful day, and they walked together in the forest, in the
magnificent walk which led to the battlements of the Loge, which were
constructed in front of the Castle Germain, by Queen Anne of Austria.
</p>
<p>
As they reached the south angle of the ramparts, it seemed that
Théophraste recognized again, gliding in a thicket, the repulsive form of
Signor Petito.
</p>
<p>
Adolphe insisted that he was mistaken.

<h3>
<i>Théophraste&rsquo;s Memory Is Refreshed</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HEY wandered down to the lawns at the foot of the ramparts, and walking
across the green grass, they stopped at the foot of a forked tree. They
were seated chatting for some time, when suddenly Théophraste&rsquo;s face
seemed to light up as if he recalled something. It seemed as if his memory
had suddenly become awakened to events of years ago. His whole soul was
filled with sweet memories, like the tenderest recollections of youthful
days returning, after having been forgotten for a long time. In his mind
he saw perfectly the spirit of Cartouche, as if he had never been
separated from him by two hundred years. It seemed to come suddenly to
him, and as the events came back to him, he related them to Adolphe, in
the following words:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Adolphe, my friend, I must tell you that at that time my fortune was
complete. I was dreaded and yet liked by all. I was even liked by my
victims. I despoiled them so gallantly that they went their way along
through the city singing my praises. I had not yet been attacked by that
wonderful sanguinary instinct which some months later made me commit the
most atrocious crimes. Everything prospered with me; everybody feared me
and loved me. I was happy, merry, of a magnificent audacity, gallant in
love, and the ruler of Paris. They said that I was the greatest of all
robbers; that was only half true, because it was imperative that I should
partake of the sovereignty with M. Law, the Controller-General of Finance.
My glory was at its zenith; for often he and his people paid me tribute.
But he imagined he might excite the Regent against me. One evening when I
had stolen into his room in his hotel, disguised as a lackey to Lord
Dermott, the Regent sent for Monsieur d&rsquo;Argenson, keeper of the seals, and
told him that he had eight hours in which to arrest me. M. d&rsquo;Argenson
promised everything he wanted, provided they let him go by the way of the
Convent of the Madeline du Frainel, where his mistress, Mlle. Husson, had
taken refuge. Eight hours later, M. d&rsquo;Argenson was still at the Convent
with Mlle. Husson. As for me, my dear Adolphe, during that time, I
attended to my small affairs, and I commanded without any trouble three
thousand men. It was the month of September, the nights were beautiful and
clear, and we profited by this to get into the house of the Spanish
Ambassador, who lived in the old hotel of the Marshal d&rsquo;Aucre, in the Rue
de Fournon, the same house even which has since been occupied by the Guard
de Paris. We entered his wife&rsquo;s bedroom and took possession of all her
dresses, of a buckle ornament with twenty-seven large diamonds, a necklace
of very fine pearls, six plates, six table sets, six knives and ten coral
goblets. We rolled it all up in a table cloth, and went to supper at the
house of the Belle Helene, who kept what you called the Inn of the Harp in
the Rue de la Harp.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Adolphe, what a wonderful thing memory is! Truly I do not know why I
said that <i>you</i> called it the Inn of the Harp, unless in my mind you
are representing a friend whom I had, who was as good as you, and whom I
loved as well as you, whose name was Va-de-Bon Cour. By the Thunder of the
Breast, but he was a handsome young fellow! He was a sergeant of the
French Guards, and he was my lieutenant. I must tell you, my dear Adolphe,
that I commanded a considerable number of French Guardsmen. At the time of
my arrest, one hundred and fifty non-commissioned officers, soldiers of
the French Guard, hid themselves, and disappeared over to the colonies.
They dreaded lest I should compromise them. They were wrong, however, for
torture could not make me speak. However, let me leave those melancholy
moments, and come back to the beautiful September nights. We will proceed
to the time when it was customary for the Parisians to take up their new
abodes. The Regent showed still more anger against me and M. d&rsquo;Argenson,
when he learned about the escapade against the Spanish Ambassador. Imagine
his fury as I turned my attentions to him. Va-de-Bon Cour, being on guard
at the Palais Royal, carried off two vermilion flambeaux, which the Duke
of Orleans prized very highly. The Regent was so afraid of being robbed
that instead of wearing silver-faced buckles and sword handles, he
resolved to substitute carved steel. On the first day that he carried one
of that kind, I, Cartouche, stole it from him as he was leaving the opera
house. The next day I sent it back to him in pieces, and I taunted him
about his apparent avarice, and upbraided him, that he, the greatest man
in France, should wish to deprive his unfortunate confrères, the
silversmiths, of a livelihood.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He answered me publicly by proclaiming that he was very anxious to know
me, and that he would give from his own pocket 20,000 pounds to whoever
would bring Cartouche to him. The next day, as he walked to Saint Germain
and was breakfasting in the castle, he found under his napkin a message of
which you will readily see the sense: &lsquo;My lord, you can see me for
nothing. It may be to-night, at midnight, behind the Anne of Austria Wall
in the forest, where Cartouche will expect you. You are brave. Come alone.
If you come accompanied, you run the danger of death.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;At midnight, I awaited the Regent; twelve o&rsquo;clock was still sounding in
the Loges, when the Regent appeared. The moonlight made the forest seem
like fairyland-enchanted, such as one sees at the theater. The forest, a
marvelous, transparent blue, seemed bereft of all its branches, of all its
foliage, of all its thickets.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Behold me, Cartouche,&rsquo; said the prince; &lsquo;I come to you armed with my
sword alone, as you have wished. I run perhaps the greatest danger,&rsquo; he
said in a clear, derisive voice, &lsquo;but who would not risk everything to see
at close range at midnight, in the heart of the forest, the form of
Cartouche, when it costs nothing?&rsquo; Oh, Adolphe, my friend, that thou
couldst have been there to hear me respond to the Regent of France! To be
sure, I am only the son of a poor cooper of the Rue du Pontaux-Choux, but
what Condé, what Montmorency could have bowed with more grace, sweeping
the wet grass with the plume of his hat? The Duke de Richelieu himself
could not kneel more elegantly than I did, nor present in a more gracious
manner to my lord the purse that I had taken from his pocket. &lsquo;I am,&rsquo; said
I, &lsquo;the most humble servant of my lord, and I beg him to take back from
Cartouche this purse that I had the audacity to steal with so much
coolness, only to prove to my lord that his highness finds himself face to
face with Cartouche.&rsquo; The Regent begged me to preserve that purse for a
remembrance of him. He was wrong to relate, in the course of time, this
anecdote; for the report was spread that he was one of my band. I believe
that he had started to go away, when he put his arm in mine and dragged me
as far to the right as we are sitting to-day.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then the regent did me the honor to put his arm in mine, and I saw that
he had something of a secret nature to confide to me. He did not wait to
acknowledge that he counted upon my ingenuity to avenge him for an offense
that Monsieur the Controller-General had committed against him. He told me
that he was quite in love with the courtesan, Emily; that she was his
mistress, and had been for fifteen days, and that he had learned from La
Fillon that M. Law had the promise of her favors the next night against
the present that he would make her of a ten-thousand-louis necklace. He
was sure of it, for La Fillon was never mistaken. Was it not from her that
he had had a hint of the Cellamore conspiracy? All the rogues of Paris
knew La Fillon.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;La Fillon is a woman of five feet ten inches, who was admirably formed, a
ravishingly beautiful face. From the age of fifteen years, that model
beauty thought that Nature had not provided such rare treasures to be
hidden, so she lavished them. The Duke d&rsquo;Orleans, a long time before the
regency, loved her. He remained smitten with her for more than a year. It
was for her that he had constructed, in a retired part of the gardens of
Saint Germain, a sort of grotto, lighted mysteriously by several rays
directed upon a bed of mats, upon which his mistress stretched herself,
clothed in her blonde hair only. He showed them to all who passed that
way, and in that way he made numerous friends. But the fifteen years of La
Fillon flew away in happy days. Now she had no longer the enjoyment of
intrigue, of which she has made two parts-gallantry and observation. So
she furnished some important information to the police and to M.
d&rsquo;Argenson, guard of the seals, and some remarkable subjects for the
amours of the Regent. It was she who procured Emily for him, who is by far
the prettiest girl in Paris. Everybody wanted to steal her from him. Law,
who was the richest, swore to succeed there. The bargain was concluded for
the next night.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Cartouche,&rsquo; the Regent said to me, after having explained his small
affairs to me, &lsquo;thou art a brave man. I give thee the necklace.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And he went away in the moonlight, giving me a slight wave of the hand.
This kind of mission that I received-to thwart the loves of the
Superintendent, and avenge those of the Duke of Orleans, filled me with
pride.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Being back in Paris, I learned near the morning, through my police (which
was the best information of the epoch), that the courtesan Emily lived at
a small hotel in the Mardis, at the corner of the Rue Barbette and of the
Trois-Pavillons, and that the Regent showed more attachment for her than
he had ever for the Duchess of Berry, with whom he was disgusted long
since for La Baratere, who shut herself up in the Convent of Chelles, less
on account of her love for God than for her liking for the beautiful nuns
(what morals, my dear Adolphe, what morals!), and it consoled her that she
had recently been mistaken for Mlle, de Valois, uniquely occupied with the
Duke de Richelieu. This courtesan, Emily, was no more than an opera girl,
but her beauty, as I have told you, surpassed all that one can imagine-I
was not long in judging for myself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Twenty-four hours after the interview of Saint Germain, that is to say
the midnight following, I went out with a placard describing exactly the
angle of the Rue des Trois-Pavillons and the Rue Barbette. I had, as if by
chance, a pistol in each hand, which made it impossible for me to decently
bow to Mlle. Emily, who appeared, considering the hour, in the most polite
dishabille, with the Superintendent, who presented a casket to her in
which there shone the gems of a necklace, which was valued at the least at
ten thousand louis. I excused myself for the necessity of keeping my hat
on my head, and begged Monsieur, the Superintendent, seeing the
encumbrance of my hands, to close the casket on the necklace, and to put
the whole thing in the pocket of my cinnamon coat, promising my gratitude
or recognition for this slight service.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;As he hesitated, I proceeded with my presentation, and when he knew that
my name was Cartouche, he obeyed with alacrity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I begged Mlle. Emily to reassure herself, declaring that she was in no
danger, of which she was convinced, for she began to laugh heartily at the
discomfiture of M. Law. I laughed also. I said to M. Law that his necklace
was worth 10,000 louis, but if he wished to send the next day, towards
five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, a confidence man to the corner of the Rue
Vaugirard and of the Rue des Fosses-Monsieur le Prince, with five thousand
louis, they would return the collar, on the word of honor of Cartouche. He
replied to me that the bargain was concluded and we took leave of each
other.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Two days later some one related the adventure to the Regent, who was at
first overjoyed, but whose face changed when he learned the culmination of
the event. The man, Law, had given the five thousand louis as was
arranged, to the man, Cartouche, and he expected the jewel box, when the
other told him that Cartouche had already gone to carry it himself to
Mlle. Emily. Law ran to the house of the courtesan, saw the necklace and
demanded the price.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;It is already received,&rsquo; replied Emily, turning her back on him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;And by whom?&rsquo; exclaimed M&rdquo; le Superintendent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Evidently by the one who brought me the necklace-by Cartouche, who has
just left here. Should I not pay upon receipt of the necklace? And
immediately? I have no credit, myself,&rsquo; added she, shouting over the
discomfited face of the man of the Rue Quincamprix.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;At the Palais Royal, my dear Adolphe, the jest had the success that you
can imagine. It did not matter, the Regent had found out that I had
surpassed his instructions, and in his anger he again sent M. d&rsquo;Argenson
to hunt for me. He, however, was again diverted by the attractions of
Mlle. Husson. It was a fact, my dear Adolphe, that women were a source of
great help to me, and I leaned towards them considerably. But they
contributed much to my ruin, also. Knowing of the propriety of my manners,
and of my exclusive love for Marceline, you must think how two hundred
years changes a man.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Elated at his narrative, Adolphe laughed at the pleasantry which
terminated it. &ldquo;How two hundred years changes a man!&rdquo; M. Longuet laughed
at it. The supernatural and terrifying antithesis between Cartouche and
Longuet, which had plunged him at first into the most melancholy fright,
now incited him to make jests. His excuse was that he did not see anything
to fear. He only found his case a little odd. He joked about it with
Adolphe, and even resolved to no longer keep his true personality from
Marceline. She was intelligent and would understand. He imagined that this
personality would present dangers to himself and to society, but, behold!
it existed no longer in the real condition, but only in his memory, as a
vivid picture. He would not have to control Cartouche as he had dreaded;
he would only have to ask him from time to time, some anecdote, which
would help M. Longuet in conversation. The history of the Regent, M. Law,
and of the courtesan, were sure proofs of that condition of the soul. How
it had glided from his memory without effort! What evil, then, was there
in that? After all, if he had been Cartouche, it was not his fault, and it
would be very foolish in him to be angry about it. He even joked about the
fortune.
</p>
<p>
At midnight they made their way back to Paris. As they arrived at the
station St. Lazare, M. Lecamus asked him the following question:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My friend, when you are Cartouche, and you take your walks in Paris, and
you see the life of Paris, what astonishes you most? Is it the telephone,
or the railway, or the Metro, or the Eiffel Tower?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste replied, &ldquo;No, no. That which astonishes me most when I am
Cartouche is the police force.&rdquo;
 </p>

<h2>
CHAPTER XIII
</h2>
<h3>
<i>The Cat</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T seems that the destiny which controls the lives of men, takes a
diabolical pleasure in preceding the worst catastrophe by the serenest of
joys. Thus is it often that we are warned of the tempest by the calm.
</p>
<p>
Thus in the beginning of the misfortunes of Théophraste, Marceline and
Adolphe, there was something which was not of very great importance in
itself-the strange behavior of a small black cat.
</p>
<p>
I have not yet described in detail the apartment occupied by the household
of Longuet in the Rue Geronde. It is now necessary to do so. It was a
small apartment, rented for twelve hundred francs a year, on passing
through the folding-doors of which one entered a vestibule of restricted
dimensions, all the furniture of which consisted of a polished oak trunk,
which seemed to fill the whole vestibule. Besides the front door, four
doors opened into the vestibule: the kitchen door, the dining-room door,
to the left; the parlor door, and that of the bedroom, on the right. The
parlor and bedroom windows looked out into the street, and those of the
kitchen and dining-room looked out into the court. The window of the
little room in which M. Longuet had made his office, opened on the street
also. This room was between the bedroom and the dining-room, and could be
entered by doors from either of these. As to the furniture in this
apartment, that in the office is all that need be described. There was a
small desk against the wall.
</p>
<p>
These great misfortunes of Théophraste, Marceline and Adolphe centered
around something which was not of great importance in itself: it was only
an ornament in the form of a small black cat, which was placed over the
patent lock with which the small desk was fastened, thus hiding it.
</p>
<p>
This little black cat was nothing more than an ingenious silken cushion,
which served the double purpose of pin-cushion and pen-wiper. There was
also a tea-table in this room.
</p>
<p>
Upon returning from their trip, Adolphe accompanied Théophraste up the
stairway, and as it was late he announced his intention of leaving at
once. He ordered his friend to go to bed so that he might get up early the
next day to make further researches. He shook his hand with a show of
sincerity, and as he went downstairs, looked up to Théophraste, who was
holding the lamp for him, and murmured, &ldquo;Good-bye, till to-morrow.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste closed the door of the apartment with the greatest care, and
as he made the second turn to the latch, he said to Marceline, &ldquo;Now that
we are very often in the country, we ought to have extra bolts for
safety.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste and Marceline searched the apartment before going to bed. They
went into the kitchen, into the dining-room, into the parlor, and into the
office. Nothing unusual had happened during their absence. Everything was
in its usual place.
</p>
<p>
Having gone to bed, Théophraste lay awake for some time. He amused himself
by thinking of Cartouche and all the wonderful things he had done. While
he tried to fall asleep, his mind kept continually going back to the same
theme. Suddenly he opened his frightened eyes in the darkness, and laid
his hand on his wife&rsquo;s arm, waking her. Then, in a voice so low that he
alone knew he had spoken, he said, &ldquo;Do you hear anything?&rdquo; Marceline woke
with a start, and they both strained their ears. They heard something in
the apartment. It was a peculiar sound like the purring of a cat. It
seemed as if it came from the office, and they listened intently for some
minutes, too frightened to move.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste, as we have said before, was not a brave man, and he would
have given a hundred thousand francs for it to have been daylight.
Marceline whispered in his ear, &ldquo;Go and see what is the matter. You must,
Théophraste. Take the revolver from the table drawer.&rdquo; Théophraste just
had the strength to answer, &ldquo;You know very well it is not loaded.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
They listened again, but the noise had stopped. Marceline hoped that they
had been mistaken. Théophraste, quaking with fear, then got out of the
bed, and taking the revolver, softly opened the door which led into the
office.
</p>
<p>
The night was clear, and the moon shone across the large blue table-cloth
which was spread on the table. Théophraste recoiled. He pushed the door to
by pressing his back against it, as if he would hinder whatever he had
seen from entering the room. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; demanded Marceline, raising
herself from the pillows. Théophraste, with chattering teeth, answered,
&ldquo;It does not purr any more, but it has moved. It is on the tea-table.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What is on the tea-table?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The cat!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you sure it was in its right place last night?&rdquo; asked Marceline.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perfectly sure. I put my scarf-pin on it when I was going to bed.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you only think that you did it,&rdquo; said Marceline. &ldquo;Shall I light the
lamp?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no. We can escape in the darkness. If I open the door on the landing
we can call the conciergerie.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are not afraid, then?&rdquo; asked Marceline, who, now that she heard it
was the cat, was recovering her senses. &ldquo;It was an illusion that we had.
You must have changed his place last night.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;After all it is very possible,&rdquo; said Théophraste. He only wanted to get
back to bed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Put it in its place,&rdquo; insisted Marceline. Théophraste decided to do so.
He went into the office, and with a hasty, trembling hand took the cat
from the tea-table and put it on the desk, and soon found himself back in
bed. By this time they had recovered their composure.
</p>
<p>
They even smiled in the darkness to think that they had been afraid.
However, a quarter of an hour elapsed, and they were frightened to hear
again the rattle of the ornament. &ldquo;Oh, it is not possible,&rdquo; cried
Marceline; &ldquo;we are the victims of hallucination. There is nothing to
astonish us after what has happened at the Conciergerie.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was Marceline who got up this time. She pulled open the door of the
office, and came back at once towards Théophraste, and said with a voice
so weak that it seemed far away, &ldquo;You did not, then, put the cat back on
the desk?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I did,&rdquo; growled Théophraste.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, but it is back on the tea-table.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; said the man hiding his head under the coverings.
</p>
<p>
Marceline was convinced that, in the disordered condition of his mind, he
had left the cat on the tea-table. She took it, holding her breath, and
put it on the table. The cat rattled audibly again as she did it, but
neither Marceline nor Théophraste saw anything in this. Marceline went
back to bed again.
</p>
<p>
Another quarter of an hour passed, at the end of which they again heard
the same noise. Then an incredible thing happened. Théophraste turned like
a tiger and cried out, &ldquo;What is it? It is only too true, something unusual
is happening.&rdquo;

CHAPTER XIV
</h2>
<h3>
<i>Petito Loses His Ears</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>E will now go downstairs to the flat below, into the apartment occupied
by Signor and Signora Petito. Signora Petito is saying, &ldquo;I do not
understand M. Longuet&rsquo;s conduct at the dinner at all. He spoke such vague,
peculiar words.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answers Signor Petito, &ldquo;he has this treasure which may be found in
the environs of Paris, and he is thinking of it. It is certainly very
interesting, and I would like to find it myself. According to the
document, my opinion is that one ought to look either at the side of
Montrouge, or at the side of Montmartre. I am inclined to think that it is
Montmartre, on acount of the &lsquo;Coq.&rsquo; There was a castle &lsquo;Coq de Percherons&rsquo;
there. You will find it if you look at this plan of old Paris.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
They looked at the plan, and after a short silence Signor Petito added,
&ldquo;It is still very vague. For myself, I think that one ought to attach
importance to the words &lsquo;Le Four.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear, then it is more and more vague,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;for there are
many furnaces around Paris. There were plaster furnaces, and quicklime
furnaces, and many others.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My idea,&rdquo; said Signor Petito, &ldquo;is that Le Four does not mean &lsquo;the
furnaces.&rsquo; I remember that there was a space after the word &lsquo;Four,&rsquo; on the
paper. Pass my dictionary.&rdquo; Signora Petito, noiselessly, and with great
care, brought him the lexicon. They looked over all the words beginning
with the syllable &lsquo;Four.&rsquo; On account of the article, le, they decided not
to pay any attention to feminine words.
</p>
<p>
Just then the clock on the mantel-shelf struck midnight. Signora Petito
got up, and said to the Signor, &ldquo;Now is the time. We will find some useful
information on the floor above. They cannot hear you in your stockinged
feet. I will watch behind their door at the head of their stairway. You
know there is no danger, they are still in the country.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Two minutes later a form glided over the landing at M. Longuet&rsquo;s door, put
a key into the lock stealthily, and went into the vestibule. M. Longuet&rsquo;s
apartment was arranged exactly like Signor Petito&rsquo;s, and so the latter
easily found his way into the dining-room. He acted with perfect
composure, believing the apartment to be uninhabited. He pushed the office
door open. As it was evidently the lock of the desk that he wished to
reach. Signor Petito took the ornament which inconvenienced him and placed
it on the tea-table. Then he quitted the room noiselessly, and entered the
dining-room, from there into the vestibule, for he seemed to hear a voice
on the stairway. He was without doubt mistaken, for he listened intently
for some time without hearing a sound. When he came back into the office,
he found the cat again on the desk, and purring. His hair seemed to stand
on end, for the horror which had seized upon him was not to be compared to
the horror which had seized upon those in the next room.
</p>
<p>
Signor Petito remained immovable in the bluish moonlight. With a timid
hand he seized the little black cat. The movement caused by this made the
cat purr again. Now he understood that in the cat&rsquo;s pasteboard body there
was a little ball, balanced in such a manner that it ingeniously simulated
the purring of a cat when it was moved.
</p>
<p>
How frightened he had been! He felt a fool. All was explained. Did he not
remove the cat before returning to the vestibule? Instead of having placed
the cat on the table, as he thought, he must have replaced it on the desk.
That was a simple explanation, and he paid the strictest attention this
time when he placed it on the table.
</p>
<p>
While he was doing this there was a fresh noise on the stairway. It was
only Signora Petito, who had very incautiously sneezed.
</p>
<p>
Signor Petito went hurriedly and silently back into the vestibule, and
when he was reassured, went back into the office again.
</p>
<p>
The black cat had been returned to the desk again!
</p>
<p>
He thought that he would die of fright. A miraculous intervention had
arrested him on the verge of a great crime, and he uttered a hurried
prayer in which he promised heaven never to do it again. However, another
quarter of an hour passed, and he attributed these surprising events to
his conscience, and returning, placed the cat back again on the table.
</p>
<p>
Just then the door of the room was violently opened, and Signor Petito
fell into the arms of M. Longuet, who did not express the least
astonishment.
</p>
<p>
M. Longuet threw Signor Petito on the floor in disgust, and picking up the
ornament, opened the window, and threw it out into the street. During this
time, Signor Petito, who had gotten up, could hardly compose his features,
for Mme. Longuet, in her chemise, was threatening him with a revolver. He
could only stammer, &ldquo;I beg your pardon, I really thought that you were in
the country.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
M. Longuet went up to him, and taking him by one of his ears, said, &ldquo;Now,
my dear Signor Petito, we must talk.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Marceline lowered the barrel of her revolver, and felt pleased at seeing
her husband show such courage.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You see, my dear Signor Petito,&rdquo; continued Théophraste, &ldquo;that I am calm.
A little while ago I was getting angry, but it was only at that little cat
which was keeping me from going to sleep, and which I have thrown out of
the window. Rut be assured, my dear Signor, I shall not throw you out of
the window. You have not kept me from sleeping, you have even taken the
precaution to put on slippers. Many thanks. But why, my dear Signor, do
you make that ridiculous grimace? It is without doubt on account of your
ear. I have some good news to tell you which will perhaps put you at ease
about your ears. Your ears will make you suffer no more.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Having finished his sarcastic talk, Théophraste begged his wife to pass
him a cloth, and ordered Signor Petito to go into the kitchen. &ldquo;Do not be
surprised that I receive you in the kitchen. I prize my carpets very much,
and you will probably bleed like a pig.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
M. Longuet drew towards him a white wooden table, which he placed in the
middle of the kitchen. He asked Marceline to place an oil-cloth over the
table, and get him a large bowl. He then asked for a carving set, which he
said she would find in the dresser drawer, which stood in the dining-room.
Marceline tried to ask for an explanation, but her husband looked at her
so coldly and so strangely, that, shuddering, she could only obey. Signor
Petito, in a cold perspiration, tried to reach the door of the kitchen,
but M. Longuet stood between him and the means of exit, and commanded him
to be seated.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Signor Petito,&rdquo; said he, in a tone of the most sarcastic politeness, &ldquo;you
have a face which displeases me. It is not your fault; but then it is not
mine, either. Certainly you are by far the most cowardly and the most
despicable of thieves. But what does that matter? But do not smile, Signor
Petito.&rdquo; It is certain that Signor Petito had no intention of smiling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have ridiculously large ears, and surely with such ears, you dare not
pass by the corner of the Guiliere.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Signor Petito clasped his hands and stammered, &ldquo;But my wife awaits me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What are you doing, Marceline?&rdquo; Théophraste cried impatiently. &ldquo;Do not
you see that Signor Petito is in a hurry? His wife is waiting for him.
Have you the carving set?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I could not find the fork,&rdquo; answered Marceline in a trembling voice. (The
truth was, Marceline did not know what to say, for she believed that her
husband had become completely insane, and between Signor Petito the
house-breaker, and Théophraste mad, she was in anything but an enviable
position.) She had hidden herself behind a cupboard door, and her distress
was so extreme, that in turning suddenly, when Théophraste hurled a volley
of insults at her, she upset her favorite vase, which made a loud noise,
thus adding to the confusion.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste resorted once more to oaths and insults, and called Marceline
in such a tone that she ran to him in spite of herself. The spectacle
which awaited her in the kitchen was atrocious. Signor Petito was lying on
the wooden table, his eyes bursting from their orbits, a handkerchief in
his mouth, which nearly suffocated him. Théophraste had had the time, and
was possessed with the extraordinary strength to tie his hands and ankles
with cords. Signor Petito&rsquo;s head hung a little beyond the edge of the
table, and under it there was a bowl which M. Longuet had placed there to
prevent soiling anything. The latter with palpitating nostrils had caught
Signor Petito by the hair with his left hand. In his right he clasped the
handle of a notched kitchen knife.
</p>
<p>
Gnashing his teeth, he cried out, &ldquo;Strike the flags.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
As he said this he made the first cut at the right ear. The cartilage
resisted. Signor Petito&rsquo;s muffled groans could just be heard. M. Longuet,
who was still in his night-shirt, worked like a surgeon bent upon a
difficult operation. Marceline&rsquo;s strength failed her, and she fell upon
her knees. Signor Petito, in attempting to struggle, threw the blood from
his ears across the kitchen, and Théophraste, letting go his hair, struck
him a blow across the head. &ldquo;Be a little careful,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are
splashing the blood all over everything.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The cartilage still resisted, so taking the right ear in his left hand,
with a strong blow with the notched knife he tore it away. He placed the
ear in a saucer which he had previously placed on the sink, and allowed
the water to flow over it. Then he came back to the second ear. Marceline
groaned very loudly, but he silenced her with a glance. The second ear was
cut off much more easily, and with more dispatch.
</p>
<p>
By this time Signor Petito had swallowed half of the handkerchief, and was
suffocating. Théophraste took the handkerchief out of his mouth and threw
it out into the clothes-basket near by. He then untied his ankles and
wrists, and signed to him to leave the apartment as soon as possible. He
had the forethought to wrap his head in a dish-cloth, so that the blood
would not stain the stairway or the janitor&rsquo;s family. As Signor Petito
passed by, in agony, Théophraste put the washed ears into his vest pocket.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You forgot something,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What would Signora Petito say if you
went back without your ears?&rdquo; He closed the door. Looking at Marceline,
who was on her knees, paralysed with horror, he wiped the bloody knife on
his sleeve.

CHAPTER XV
</h2>
<h3>
<i>Adolphe Consulted</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HEOPHRASTE, the next day, seemed to have forgotten all the incidents of
the night before, or at least to attach very little importance to them.
</p>
<p>
As to Marceline, she was far too agitated to make any direct mention of
it. However, she knew Adolphe would be calling at noon and she was
resolved to find out the cause of Théophraste&rsquo;s actions before he came so
that she could tell Adolphe the best to act. The thing that struck her
most was Théophraste&rsquo;s sudden show of courage and strength. Before he had
shown excessive lack of courage, and he was naturally physically weak.
Suddenly, to be seized with all the nerve necessary to meet a burglar and
then to have the strength to gag and bind him and cut off his ears, was
unnatural. He had always recoiled from the sight of blood, and here he was
fairly reveling in it. What could all this mean? He had suddenly turned
from a quiet, inoffensive citizen to a ghoul.
</p>
<p>
It was with these thoughts that she approached Théophraste and demanded an
explanation. He at first was loath to tell her, but her entreaties
prevailed, and he eventually told her that it was the spirit of Cartouche
that had seized him and forced him to do these horrible actions. He told
her with a sort of bravado that there had been more than one hundred and
fifty assassinations laid to his account.
</p>
<p>
Marceline was in a terrible state of mind and shrank from him. She
declared that nothing in the world would make her live with him. She would
apply for a divorce. She thought she had married an honest man, and now
she had discovered him to be a thief and murderer. Here were enough
grounds for a separation, and she declared her intention of securing it.
</p>
<p>
At this Théophraste became very melancholy, and entreated her to think of
his side of the calamity. He told her how necessary her help was to him,
and with Adolphe&rsquo;s and her assistance he thought he could throw off this
evil influence. By this time he had become quite rational, and they
decided to consult Adolphe, and if necessary, have him live with them.
</p>
<p>
Marceline readily acquiesced in this suggestion. Adolphe arrived about 1
o&rsquo;clock, and she took him into the sitting-room and was soon in earnest
and animated council with him. Théophraste went into his office and waited
anxiously for them to join him. After some time they returned, and
Marceline insisted that Théophraste should do all that Adolphe should ask
of him, which he readily consented to do, having confidence in his friend.
</p>
<p>
Later on in the afternoon Théophraste and Adolphe went for a walk into the
city. Théophraste immediately began asking questions as to Adolphe&rsquo;s
progress in the search for the treasures. He, however, was in no mood to
tell much. Marceline&rsquo;s story of the night before had driven all thoughts
of the treasure out of his head, and he answered somewhat abruptly that
nothing of importance had been found, and that he must think of
Théophraste&rsquo;s health first, before taking any further steps.
</p>
<p>
It was obvious to Théophraste that Adolphe was evading the subject, and he
was determined to find out more of the matter.
</p>
<p>
He felt that Adolphe had more information, and so pressed him to speak.
Adolphe then told how he had discovered that after the war most of the
soldiers who had been serving with Cartouche had been discharged, and were
left with no means of livelihood, and so, recognizing him as having the
talent of a leader, they formed themselves into a party of bandits, and
placed him at their head. At this time the police force of Paris was quite
inadequate to cope with the many crimes; therefore Cartouche and his
comrades resolved to turn their attention to this. He divided his men into
troops, and gave them each a quarter, to guard over which he placed an
intelligent lieutenant. When anybody was found out after curfew he was
politely accosted and requested to turn over a sum of money, or if he had
no money on him, to part with his coat. In exchange for this he was given
a pass which entitled him to walk through Paris in perfect security at any
time he pleased. He would have nothing to fear from Cartouche&rsquo;s men. If he
showed any resistance he was immediately killed. Cartouche had the clergy
on his side, and was often able to make good use of them. One priest named
Le Ratichon, was even hanged for him.
</p>
<p>
On reaching the Hotel de Ville, Adolphe stopped and asked Théophraste if
he cared to cross the Place de l&rsquo;Hotel de Ville.
</p>
<p>
He answered, &ldquo;If you wish, certainly we will.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you often crossed the place?&rdquo; said Adolphe.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, very often,&rdquo; replied Théophraste.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And nothing unusual has happened? Is there any place in Paris which you
have some difficulty in passing?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, no, of course not. What is there to hinder me from going anywhere?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
However, Adolphe&rsquo;s look made him reflect, and then he recalled having
several times walked up the Place de l&rsquo;Ordson, and when in front of the
Institute he changed his mind and retraced his steps. He accounted for
this rather by his absent-mindedness than by anything unusual. He recalled
that he had never passed through the Rue Mazarine or crossed the
Pont-Neuf. Neither had he crossed the Petit Pont. He had always turned at
the corner of the Rue Ville du Temple, near the house with the grated
windows.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Adolphe asked, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you pass these places?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I think it is because the paving stones are red; and I dislike that
color.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You remember the Place de Grere?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, yes. It was there that the pillory and scaffold were erected. The
wheel was placed there on execution days in front of the Rue Vanniere.
There was the old coal harbor. I never passed that place without
counselling my comrades to avoid the wheel. However, I will wager not one
profited by it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nor you either,&rdquo; said Adolphe. &ldquo;It was there that you suffered the final
torment. It was there that you were racked and expired by the tortures of
the wheel.&rdquo;
 </p>

<h2>
CHAPTER XVI
</h2>
<h3>
<i>On Private Ground</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>MONG all the paper that I found in the oaken chest, those which related
to the death of Cartouche were by far the most curious, and presented the
highest interest, in that they partly contradicted history. They denied
with such persuasive strength, and such undeniable logic, that it is
difficult to see how the great historians could have overlooked the real
details, and the generations which have succeeded since the year 1721,
should not have suspected the truth. History teaches us that Cartouche,
after having suffered the rack in its most cruel form, during which he
confessed nothing, not even a name or a fact, this Cartouche, who had only
to die, and nothing to gain from his confession, nothing to soften his
last moments, was brought to torment in the Place de la Grere, and it was
there that he decided to speak. That they took him back to the Hotel de
Ville, and that it was there that he betrayed his principal accomplices,
after which he was racked and fastened to the cross, where he expired.
</p>
<p>
Immediately after this 360 persons were arrested, with the result that
they were tried, and judicially massacred, the last one of them being
executed two years after Cartouche.
</p>
<p>
Now in following the papers of Théophraste, we are not doing full justice
to Cartouche. While Cartouche was an object of terror, he was at the same
time an object of admiration. His courage knew no bounds, and he proved it
at the time of his torture. At the moments when his sufferings were
greatest, he did not speak. It was said that he only wished to die
bravely. The great ladies of the court and of the city had hired windows
and points of vantage from which to witness his death, and he did not wish
to show them on the scaffold, a cowardly dastard, but the most daring and
bravest of bandits. It is an historical fact that of the 360 persons who
were arrested after his death, it was found that Cartouche was loved by
all. The official report showed women throwing themselves in the arms of
L&rsquo;Enfant at the Hotel de Ville, even after the denunciation.
</p>
<p>
It is not necessary to mention all the protests that M. Longuet made
against the dishonorable death attributed to Cartouche, but some of the
preceding lines seem to show that he was right.
</p>
<p>
It was while conversing on this question that Théophraste and his friend
arrived at the Rue de le Petit Pont, without passing over the bridge.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;look at that house at the side of the
hotel, which has the sign, &lsquo;To the rendezvous of the Maraiches,&rsquo; and tell
me if you find anything remarkable about it.&rdquo; They were then in front of a
low, narrow and dirty old house, a hotel. The door on the ground floor
disclosed a counter for the sale of drinks. Above the door was a notice,
&ldquo;To the rendezvous of the kitchen-gardeners.&rdquo; The hotel was leaning
against a vast building of the eighteenth century, which Théophraste
pointed out with his green umbrella. This building had a balcony of iron,
wrought in a delicate design of the period.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I observe a beautiful balcony, of which the feature in the design seems
to be the quiver of the god of love.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Anything more?&rdquo; asked Théophraste.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do not notice anything further,&rdquo; said Adolphe.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you notice the large gratings on the windows? There was a time, my
dear Adolphe, when windows that had gratings on were very much in vogue.
There were never so many grilled windows in Paris as in the year 1720, and
I would swear that these were placed there the day after the affair of the
Chateaux Augustins. The Parisians always protected their ground floor, but
this did not trouble us very much, for we had Simon L&rsquo;Auvergnat.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Adolphe took the opportunity of asking Théophraste exactly who this Simon
L&rsquo;Auvergnat was. He was always referring to him, and without any obvious
reasons.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He was a very useful person,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;he was the base of my
column.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean by the &lsquo;base of your column&rsquo;?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You do not understand. Wait, and you soon will. Imagine yourself to be
Simon L&rsquo;Auvergnat. Stand like this,&rdquo; and he indicated the position,
against the wall of the house, that Adolphe was to take. He spread his
legs and lowered his head, and raising his arms, leaned against the wall.
&ldquo;I will place you here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;on account of the cornice which is to
the left. I remember that it was very convenient. Now, since you are the
base of my column, I lean on that base and then&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Before M. Lecamus had had time to see what was going to happen,
Théophraste gripped his shoulders, leaped on the cornice of the hotel,
from there to the balcony of the hotel at the side, and entered a room of
which the window had been opened.
</p>
<p>
M. Lecamus, stupefied, looked up into the air, and was wondering to
himself how on earth his friend could have disappeared in such a way, when
suddenly piercing cries came from the room, and a voice yelled out, &ldquo;Help!
Robbers! Murder! Help!&rdquo; Fearing some dreadful act, Adolphe rushed into the
hotel. The passers-by were stopping in the street, and before long a crowd
had collected. He leapt over the vast stairway with the agility of a young
man, and arrived on the first landing at the moment the door opened, and
Théophraste appeared, hat in hand. He was bowing to an old lady, whose
teeth were chattering from fright, and whose hair was all done up in curl
papers. &ldquo;Dear madame,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;if I had believed for one instant
that I would have caused you such surprise, I would have remained
downstairs. I am neither a robber, nor an assassin, my dear madam. All
this is the fault of my friend Adolphe, who wanted me to show him how
Simon L&rsquo;Auvergnat could serve me as the base of a column.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Adolphe had already seized his arm, and was drawing him toward the
stairway. He made signs to the lady from behind Théophraste trying to make
her understand that his friend was off his head. Thereupon, she fell
unconscious into the hands of a chambermaid, and the stairway was soon
filled with a crowd.
</p>
<p>
Adolphe profited by this to take Théophraste away. They passed through
without hindrance, and were soon in the street again. Adolphe seemed not
to hear Théophraste&rsquo;s protests. With one hand he dragged him towards the
Rue Huchette, and with the other dried the sweat which was running down
his forehead.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where are you taking me to?&rdquo; asked Théophraste.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To the house of one of my friends in the Rue Huchette.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
When they reached the house in the Rue Huchette, they passed under a red
porch, and into a very old house. Adolphe seemed to know the people, for
he did not wait to be ushered in. He made Théophraste climb half a dozen
stone steps which were extremely worn, and pushed open a thick door which
was at the end of the court.
</p>
<p>
They were now in a sort of vestibule, lighted by a large lamp in the shape
of a huge ball, suspended by iron chains from the stone ceiling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wait for me here,&rdquo; said Adolphe, after having closed the door by which
they had entered. He promised not to be long and disappeared.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste seated himself in a large armchair, and looked around him.
What he saw on the wall amused him. There was an incredible quantity of
words painted in black letters. They seemed to cover the whole surface of
the wall, in no sort of order at all. He spelt some of them. There was
Iris, Thabet, Rush, Jakin, Bokez, Thebe, Paracaler, and the word &ldquo;Iboah,&rdquo;
 which appeared in many places. Turning toward the other wall, against
which he had been leaning, he saw a Sphinx and the Pyramids.
</p>
<p>
An immense arch arose, and in the center of this was Christ, His arms
extended out into a circle of flowers. On the arch were the words,
&ldquo;Amphitheater of the wise eternal son of Truth.&rdquo; It was the arch of the
&ldquo;Rose Cross.&rdquo; Below was this inscription, &ldquo;There are none so blind as
those who will not see.&rdquo; Looking around he came across another
inscription, in letters of gold: &ldquo;As soon as you have won a fact, apply
yourself to it with your whole mind. Look for the salient points in it.
Behold the knowledge which is in it. Give way to the hypothesis. Hunt for
the fault in it.&rdquo; (Instructions to the clinic of the Hotel Dieu, Prof.
Trousseau.) Besides this he saw figures of forles and vultures and
jackals, men with birds&rsquo; heads, beetles, and the emblem of Osiris-an ass,
and an eye. Finally he read these words in blue letters: &ldquo;The more the
soul is rooted in her instincts, the more will she be forgotten in the
flesh, the less consciousness she will have of her immortality, and the
more she will remain a prisoner in living corpses.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Impatient at the absence of his friend, and becoming a little frightened,
he attempted to raise the drapery behind which Adolphe had disappeared.
But as he ascended the step his head struck an object which was suspended
in the air, and looking up he found it was a skeleton.
</p>
<p>
We have said that M. Lecamus had applied himself to the occult sciences,
and practiced spiritualism, but from what we know of M. Lecamus&rsquo;
character, we feel that he was only an amateur in these things. He only
practiced spiritualism for show, for snobbery, and to make an impression
at the parties which he used to frequent. He believed no more in
spiritualism than he believed in love. The day came, however, when his
heart gave way, and when his spirit humiliated itself. It was the day that
he met Marceline and M. Eliphaste de St. Elm. He met Marceline at a
seance, where they had made him the father spirit. At this séance M.
Eliphaste was recognized as the chief. However, this gentleman was rarely
seen. He led a most retired and mysterious life at the foot of the Rue
Huchette.
</p>
<p>
Marceline had attended this seance by the will of M. Longuet, who, having
been to the Salon Pneumatics, insisted that Marceline should be presented
there. He thought that it was a kind of worldly society, where such
subjects as pneuma-tology were discussed.
</p>
<p>
The day that Marceline made her entrance to the Salon M. Eliphaste de St.
Elm was to read a paper on the Gourse. Mme. Longuet found herself by
chance next to M. Lecamus, and after discussing a good many points in the
lecture, they found that they had a great many things in common, and by a
curious chance M. Lecamus discovered that he was an old college chum of M.
Longuet&rsquo;s. It was thus that he became welcomed into the family circle of
M. Longuet.
</p>
<p>
This preamble is necessary for us to understand the presence of M. Lecamus
and Marceline together in the house of M. Eliphaste de St. Elm, at the
foot of the Rue de Huchette, while Théophraste was waiting for him wearily
in the vestibule. The visit was the result of a conversation between M.
Lecamus and Mme. Longuet, early that morning. She had hidden nothing from
him regarding the events of the nights before, and the history of Signor
Petito&rsquo;s ears showed to M. Lecamus the necessity of taking precautions
against the spirit of Cartouche. At the bottom of his heart M. Lecamus
felt to a certain extent guilty for the follies of Théophraste, and he had
been asking himself, lately, just how far he could let this reincarnated
soul go, for M. Lecamus was a novice at spiritualism, and it was his
intention to experiment with Théophraste and Cartouche.
</p>
<p>
He was no sooner assured of having in his hands a reincarnated soul, than
his curiosity aroused in him a desire to make use of it. This was exactly
what he had done in putting the reincarnated soul of Cartouche before his
portrait, without taking any precautions, and now he did not know how he
could stop that which he had unconsciously set in motion. He knew how to
arouse such a spirit, but he did not know how to stop it.
</p>
<p>
It was for this reason that he and Mme. Longuet had come this morning to
beg M. St. Elm to exercise his influence, for there was not a cleverer
guide for reincarnated souls in Paris.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Théophraste had been locked up in the vestibule, and when
he struck his head against the skeleton, he began to think that it would
be more tranquil in a mound at St. Chaumont. The corridor in which he
found himself did not have a single window. A red gloom lighted it from
one end to the other. It came from the cellar, and penetrated the thick
pavement glass. The corridor had crevices and angles. He came to a corner
and stopped abruptly. He was impatient to go ahead, and went into one of
the two branching passageways which ran from the corridor. Five minutes
later he found himself at the same cross passage. Then he went up the
first corridor again, taking the direction that he had followed in coming
out to the vestibule, but to his great surprise he could not find the
vestibule. He wandered about for what seemed to him several hours, and he
was just giving up hope of ever getting out of this labyrinth, when he saw
Adolphe in the distance. He ran up to him and was on the point of
reproving him for having kept him waiting so long, when Adolphe said to
him sadly: &ldquo;Come, Marceline is in there; we are going to present you to a
good friend.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste found himself in a large, dark room, where his attention was
attracted by a great light which fell on the figure of a man. But strange
to say, the light did not seem to fall on the man, but rather to radiate
from him. In fact, when the figure moved it seemed to carry the light with
it. Before the flambeau a woman was standing in a humble attitude, with
clasped hands and bowed head.
</p>
<p>
Then Théophraste heard a voice, a friendly voice, a manly voice, a voice
sweeter than the sweetest voice of woman, which said to him: &ldquo;Come to me
without fear.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
That which astonished M. Longuet above all else was the astral light which
showed up the noble features of M. Eliphaste de St. Elm. He was a person
of divine elegance, as elegant as a Christ on the Tripoli.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do not know where I am,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;but it gives me confidence
to see my friend Adolphe, and my wife, Marceline, at your side. However, I
should like to know your name.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said the harmonious voice, &ldquo;I am called M. Eliphaste de St.
Elm.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;my name is Cartouche. But it has been believed
for a long, long time that this name was given to me as a nickname.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are not Cartouche,&rdquo; said Eliphaste.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your name is Théophraste Longuet. You will pardon me, but there is no
longer any need for confusion; you were formerly called Cartouche, but now
you are called Théophraste Longuet.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
M. Théophraste then recalled a number of personages with whom he had, in
the spirit of Cartouche, been speaking. They were all of the eighteenth
century-Gatelard, Marie Antoinette Neron, and others, and it was evident
that his mind was dwelling on that period, and he was living in the
present a life of the past.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste was still talking of these times, when the half shadows which
seemed to envelop him were suddenly dissipated, and the room appeared in
the splendid brightness of day. He looked around with evident
satisfaction, first at his wife, and then at Adolphe, and finally at M.
Eliphaste. Eliphaste had entirely lost his supernatural aspect, his astral
mantle had disappeared, and if his features had still their sublime and
unusual pallor, he seemed, nevertheless, a man like other men.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, this is better,&rdquo; said Théophraste, sighing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is not necessary for you to think any more of old Paris,&rdquo; said M.
Eliphaste. &ldquo;You have nothing more to do with it. You are Théophraste, and
it is the year of grace, 1899.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; replied Théophraste, who was obstinate; &ldquo;but the question is,
what about my treasure? I have a perfect right to look at a plan of old
Paris, for I can follow the place where I buried it formerly, and find the
place where I must look.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Eliphaste, speaking to Lecamus, said, &ldquo;I have often witnessed the crises
of Karma, but never has it been given to me to study one of such
strength.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Eliphaste reflected, and then leading Théophraste to the right, he brought
him before a map of real Paris. &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the exact point where
Le Fouches de Mount Fançons were. As to the mouth of the Choppinettes, and
of the Coq, they were at those two points of the Monte St. Chaumont. The
forks were found on a small eminence on the side of the principal mound,
but far to the right of where the Protestant of the Rue de Crimee stands
to-day. To find your treasure again, my friend, it will be necessary to
search in that triangle. The mounds, as you say, have been the remains of
a filled-in ditch, and I doubt very much if your treasure could still be
found there. I specified for you the old space on a modern plan to
disillusion you. You must clear your mind. Think no more on your
treasures. Do not live in the past. You must live in the present, and for
the future. You must drive away Cartouche, because Cartouche is no more.
It is Théophraste Longuet who is.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
M. Eliphaste pronounced these words with great force.

CHAPTER XVII
</h2>
<h3>
<i>They Decide to Kill</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ELIPHASTE had been reasoning with Théophraste, and using all the
arguments of spiritualists to persuade him to make an effort to rid
himself of the spirit of Cartouche.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;However,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;I thank you for the interest you have taken
in me, and for your sympathy; but I tell you, you can do nothing for me.
You say I am sick, but I am not. If I were you could cure me. You also say
that I am to drive away this Cartouche; but, though that is easily said, I
can assure you that it is not so easily done. It is impossible, my dear M.
Eli-phaste.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said M. Eliphaste, &ldquo;it is necessary. For if we do not succeed
in driving him out, we must kill him. That is an operation the result of
which I cannot vouch. It is a delicate operation, and full of dangers.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
M. Eliphaste had hoped that this obsession of Cartouche was only
imaginary, and so by reasoning he could drive it away. But, alas, the
reality of it was only too true, and Théophraste, while willing to help
him, could not get himself to believe M. Eliphaste&rsquo;s arguments.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You understand,&rdquo; said M. Eliphaste, &ldquo;your case is most extraordinary.
Everybody in the world has lived before, and will live again. This is the
Law of Karma. It may be possible to find some one who was a friend of
Cartouche&rsquo;s. The true object of that wonderful evolution of souls through
the bodies, is to develop and qualify them to enjoy the perfect happiness
which will finally be the inheritance of the fortunate ones who will enter
into the Kingdom of Heaven. It is thought that at each birth, the
personality differs from the preceding one, but it is only the veritable,
divine and spiritual I. These divers personalities are in some measures
only the links of the infinite chain of life, which constitutes,
throughout the ages, our immortal individuality.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The admirable wisdom of the teaching appealed to Théophraste immensely.
Eliphaste had shown himself so much the master of his thoughts, that he
could not understand why he had remained ignorant so long, without even
having suspected these wonderful truths. He saw the great difference
between Eliphaste and Adolphe, the difference, as he said, &ldquo;between the
Man of Reason and the Learned Ape.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Eliphaste continued: &ldquo;When one is persuaded of this great truth, one need
not be astonished at the wonderful things that happen in the present-if
they recall events of former times. But to live according to the Law of
Wisdom, one must live in the present, and not look behind.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste had too often looked behind. His mind had occupied itself with
thoughts of the past. If this had continued, in a very short time
Théophraste would have gone quite mad.
</p>
<p>
And so Théophraste thought: &ldquo;I must either forget Cartouche, throw him off
completely, or develop all his characteristics.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
M. Eliphaste told them that what men call vocations to-day were only a
latent revelation of the past, and they could only be explained that way.
He told them that what was called facility among men to-day was nothing
else but retrospective sympathy for some objects that they knew better
than others, having studied them better before the real and actual life.
He said that we even assume the gesture of the past without knowing it. He
himself had seen, on the eve of the Battle of the Bourget, two young men
fall near him, handsome as demigods, brave as Castor and Pollux, and who
succumbed with grace that the heroes showed in dying at Salamis, Marathon,
or at Platies. M. Eliphaste then pressed Théophraste to his heart,
breathed on his forehead and his eyes, and then asked him if he was quite
persuaded of the truth. He said that to be happy we must seek to give an
account of ourselves, as to the perpetual changes of our condition, and
that by this we learned to live in the present, and to comprehend that the
future belonged to us entirely. Are we not the children of the Eternal, in
whose eyes a thousand years are as a day, and a day as a thousand years?
</p>
<p>
Théophraste said to him that he was not at all astonished at having been
Cartouche-it seemed so natural to his mind-that he would never more dwell
on it, and he declared that at present Cartouche was driven away.
</p>
<p>
Thereupon Marceline asked what time it was, and Adolphe told her it was
eleven o&rsquo;clock, and so they rose to take their leave. However, just before
leaving, an incident occurred which went to prove too clearly that the
spirit of Cartouche had not left Théophraste.
</p>
<p>
Upon Adolphe&rsquo;s declaring that it was eleven o&rsquo;clock, Théophraste took out
his watch and contended that it was half after eleven, and after a few
words, he said, &ldquo;You can cut off my right hand if I am wrong.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Turning to M. Eliphaste, that gentleman confirmed M. Lecamus&rsquo; statement,
whereupon Théophraste picked up a small knife which was lying near, and
would have severed his right hand but for M. Eliphaste, who, grasping the
situation, seized Théophraste&rsquo;s uplifted hand with dexterity and
incredible strength. He ordered him to drop the knife, and told him that
he was not keeping to the compact. M. Eliphaste felt that it was no good
arguing with him on the matter of the spirit of Cartouche, and despaired
of ever ridding him of the spirit by reasoning. He turned to Adolphe and
said, &ldquo;Let us go. It is too late. There is nothing to do but to kill him.&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER XVIII
</h2>
<h3>
<i>The Operation</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HIS savage onslaught, which but for the presence of mind of M. Eliphaste
would have terminated in the amputation of M. Longuet&rsquo;s hand, proved to
them that the sanguine imagination of Cartouche had so completely invaded
the brain of M. Longuet that it seemed to them the only remedy for such a
misfortune was the death of Cartouche.
</p>
<p>
M. Eliphaste did not hesitate. He had reasoned with him in vain, and had
even hoped at one time that he had been victorious, but this incident
undoubtedly proved otherwise. He rose and looked at Théophraste, giving
him a long, steady glance, which seemed to pierce the uttermost depths of
his soul. Théophraste sighed several times and began to tremble violently,
when M. Eliphaste cried, &ldquo;Cartouche, I order you to sleep.&rdquo; Théophraste
fell as if stricken on the armchair which stood behind him, and did not
make another move. His respiration was so silent that they doubted if he
still lived. Marceline ran to him alarmed, but M. Eliphaste restrained
her, saying, &ldquo;All is well. The operation of the death of Cartouche has
begun.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Adolphe knew, from several examples, that there is always a great risk
when one wishes to kill a reincarnated soul-that is to say, to throw it
back toward the past. There is a risk of killing the body in which it is
reincarnated. And so he knew that trying to kill the soul of Cartouche
without killing Théophraste was a great undertaking.
</p>
<p>
It needed all the authority, and all the science of M. Eliphaste, to calm
them in the extremity in which they found themselves. He was the most
intellectual and scientific spiritualist of the day. He had the most
absolute and domineering will that the world had seen since Jacques Molay,
to whom he had succeeded, by the supreme direction of the secret order of
Temphis. He had made an allegorical demonstration of his last treatise on
&ldquo;Psychic Surgery,&rdquo; and had analyzed the subject in his pamphlet on &ldquo;Astral
Scalpel.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It is necessary to enumerate all the accomplishments of M. Eliphaste, for
it gives Adolphe a chance of refuting in advance the reproach put upon him
for letting him treat his best friend with the utmost severity. The
criminal eccentricities of M. Longuet, of which Signor Petito was the
first victim, made him dread the most irremediable catastrophes, and it
was for this reason that he was led to consider the operation of Cartouche
as a benefit, not only possible, but probable, without too great a risk to
Théophraste. As to Mme. Longuet, her faith in M. Eliphaste was so great
that at first she only made a few remarks, so as to relieve her of any
responsibility, and then the terror that she had of sleeping with
Cartouche made her, over and above everything, desire his death.
</p>
<p>
M. Eliphaste told Adolphe to take Théophraste&rsquo;s heels, and he took and
held him under the armpits, and they carried him into the sub-cellar,
where a laboratory had been fitted up, which was lighted in the day by
gas, with large, red, hissing flames.
</p>
<p>
Mme. Longuet followed. They placed Théophraste on a bed, and bound him
down with straps. He was still under the mesmeric influence. M. Eliphaste
stood over him, watching him closely, for a quarter of an hour, during
which time there was a deep silence in the room. At length a voice was
heard. It was M. Eliphaste praying. The prayer began in this way:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;In the beginning there was silence. Oh, age Eternal, source of all ages&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
When the prayer was ended, M. Eliphaste took Théophraste by the hand and
seemed to command him without speaking. He questioned Théophraste by the
strength of his domineering spirit -only by the answers Théophraste made
could they understand what he had been commanded to tell. Théophraste
said, without effort, &ldquo;Yes, I see. Yes, I am. I am M. Théophraste Longuet;
in an apartment of the Rue Gerondeau.&rdquo; M. Eliphaste turned toward Adolphe
and Marceline. &ldquo;The operation is a bad one,&rdquo; he said in a deep voice. &ldquo;I
have put Cartouche to sleep, and Théophraste answers me. He is sleeping in
the present. We must not precipitate matters. It will be dangerous.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am in the Rue Gerondeau-in the apartment under mine-and I see stretched
on the bed a man without ears. In front of him a woman; a dark woman-she
is pretty-she is young-her name is Regina-the woman is saying to the man,
‘Signor Petito, as true as I am called Regina, and that you have lost your
ears, you will cease to see me in forty-eight hours if you have not found
the means to give me a little comfort, to which I have a right. When I
married you, you basely deceived me, both as to your fortune and as to
your intelligence. Your fortune rested only in hopes which have not been
realized. What are you going to do?&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Signor Petito replies, &lsquo;My dear Regina, you puzzle me. Leave me in peace
to find a trace of the treasures that the imbecile above is incapable of
snatching from the profound depths of the earth.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste made them understand, in his sleep, that the imbecile referred
to was Cartouche. M. Eliphaste turned toward them, saying, &ldquo;I expect that
word to make him quit the present. Now, madam, the time has come. I am
going to tempt God.&rdquo; And then he spoke in a commanding voice, in a voice
that it seemed impossible not to obey. &ldquo;Cartouche,&rdquo; said he, extending his
hand above the strapped bed with a commanding majesty, &ldquo;Cartouche, where
wast thou on the night of the first of April, 1721, at ten o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;On the night of April first, 1721, at ten o&rsquo;clock, I struck two light
blows on the door, with the intention of making them open the door of the
Tavern Reine Margot. I never should have believed that I could have
reached the ironmonger&rsquo;s shop so easily. But I had killed the horse of the
French guardsman, and I had thrown those who had followed him into the
Seine. At the Reine Margot I found Paleton, Gatelard, and Guenal Noire. La
Belle Laittiere was with them. I related the story to them while emptying
a bottle of wine. I had confidence in them, and I told them that I
suspected Va de Bon Cour-and perhaps Marie Antoinette-of having whispered
something to the spies. They cried out, but I cried out louder than they.
I announced to them that I had decided to deal summarily with all who gave
me cause to suspect them. I became very angry, and La Belle Laittiere told
me that I was no longer bearable. Was it my fault? Every one had betrayed
me. I could not sleep two nights consecutively in one place. Where, then,
were the days when all Paris was with me? Where, then, was the day of my
wedding to Marie Antoinette, when we sang the air of &lsquo;Tout joli belle
menniere, Tout joli moulin&rsquo;? Where was now my uncle Taton? Shut up in a
castle. And his son? Killed by me because he was going to denounce me. I
had done it quickly. A pistol shot, and his corpse was under a pile of
rubbish. Then I was sure of his silence. I killed the robber Pepin, and
the police officer Huron. I did not ask anything, only that they leave me
alone to police Paris for the security of everybody. My great council,&rdquo;
 this he murmured to himself, &ldquo;did not pardon me for having Jacques le
Febrere executed. I am no longer bearable, and that is because I wish to
live. After that which had come to pass,&rdquo; continued Théophraste in his
hypnotic sleep, &ldquo;and the miraculous way in which I escaped in spite of
treachery and the precautions taken by the spies, I did not conceal from
Gate-lard or from Guenal Noire that I had decided to leave them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I soon left them and opened the door of the Reine Margot. Not a soul in
the ironmonger&rsquo;s shop. I was saved. I did not even stop Magdelen, whom I
passed while walking along the walls of the cemetery, where I was going to
sleep that night. Truth was, I was going to pass the night like a robber
in my hole in the Rue Amelot. It was pouring with rain.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It would be difficult to describe the strange tone in which this narrative
was related. The undulation of the phrases, their stops and their
stations, then the peculiar monotone in which the words fell from
Théophraste&rsquo;s lips while he was in the hypnotic sleep. His face sometimes
expressed anger, sometimes contempt, and sometimes terror.
</p>
<p>
M. Lecamus, who had seen Cartouche&rsquo;s portrait, recalled that at certain
times there was a striking resemblance to that of Théophraste. Just as he
was relating the incident of passing Magdelen, and the downpour of rain,
Théophraste&rsquo;s face showed a most peculiar expression, changing from joy to
most overwhelming despair.
</p>
<p>
M. Eliphaste, leaning over the bed, asked him: &ldquo;What then, Cartouche?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste replied in a rattling voice: &ldquo;I killed a passerby.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The operation continued, but it was only by degrees that M. Eliphaste
wished to bring Cartouche to the hour of his death. Before making him live
his death, it was necessary to make him live a little of his life. That
was the reason that M. Eliphaste had thrown the spirit of Cartouche back
to the month of April, 1721.
</p>
<p>
Though the minutes following were terrible for the onlookers, they were
worse for Cartouche, who was passing through the end of his career the
second time.
</p>
<p>
It was not until October 11, 1721, that the treason bore fruit.
</p>
<p>
Coustard, sergeant in the company of Cha-bannes, took forty men and four
sergeants with him, all of whom were designated by Duchatelle, Cartouche&rsquo;s
lieutenant, who had betrayed him. This little army, in citizen clothes,
concealing its arms very mysteriously, surrounded the house pointed out by
Duchatelle.
</p>
<p>
It could not have been more than nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening when they
arrived in sight of the tavern, Au Pictolet, kept by Germain Tassard and
his wife, near the Rue des Trois Bornes. Tassard was smoking his pipe on
the doorstep, when Duchatelle came up and demanded, &ldquo;Is there nobody
upstairs? No? Where are the four ladies?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Tassard, who expected this question, said, &ldquo;Go up.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The little troop rushed in, and when they came to the room above, they
found Boloquy and Cartouche drinking wine before the fireplace. Gaillard
was in bed, and Cartouche was seated on the bed, mending his breeches.
</p>
<p>
They rushed upon him. The attack was so sudden that he had no time to make
any resistance. They tied him with strong ropes, and, placing him in the
coach, took him prisoner to Monsieur the Secretary of State. Then he was
taken to the Grande Châtelet.
</p>
<p>
He was in his shirt, having had no time to put on his breeches. He kept
cool, congratulating the lieutenant who had betrayed him on the fine
livery he wore.
</p>
<p>
As the coach passed down the road, it nearly crushed some poor wretch who
was in the way, and Cartouche, seeing his plight, shouted to him that
phrase which he seemed to have affected, &ldquo;It is necessary to look out for
the wheel.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
All the people ran out to see him on his way to the house of M. the
Secretary of State. They cried out, &ldquo;It is Cartouche! It is Cartouche!&rdquo;
 only half believing it, as they had so often been deceived.
</p>
<p>
While in the prison awaiting trial, Cartouche received many illustrious
visitors. The Regent came; the courtesan Emilie and the Mme. le Maréchale
de Boufflers followed one after the other to pay the prisoner small
attentions. Some one had composed a play, and Quinnato, the famous actor
of the time, who filled the principal rôle in it, came to ask him for
suggestions about the chief scene.
</p>
<p>
When Cartouche had been sufficiently amused, he began to think of making
his escape. He intended doing this in spite of the very close watch that
was being kept over him.
</p>
<p>
After getting out of his dungeon, and just as he was pushing the last bar
which separated him from the street and liberty, he was discovered and
caught.
</p>
<p>
Thinking that the Grande Châtelet was not strong enough for so ingenious a
man, he was bound securely in chains and taken to the Conciergerie, in the
most formidable corner of the tower of Montgomery.

CHAPTER XIX
</h2>
<h3>
<i>The Torture Chamber</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T is only the basest of literature that describes without adequate
reason the weird, the horrible. However, many authors find it necessary to
dilate upon the most satanic personalities of men, and the worst cruelties
imaginable.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, it is only with the knowledge that the recital of the
misfortunes of Théophraste is destined to throw a light on the most
obscure problems of psychic surgery that the author of these lines
proceeds with this description of the most frightful tortures, moral and
physical, that have ever been endured by man.
</p>
<p>
The operation to be performed was a singular one, and full of the gravest
of dangers. However, M. Eliphaste was in the habit of performing the most
complicated of psychic operations, and the delicacy of his astral scalpel
was universally acknowledged. But the difficulty was the delay.
</p>
<p>
Had M. Lecamus brought Théophraste earlier, the danger would have been
less, but now M. Eliphaste recognized the gravity of the case, and he said
that to kill Cartouche without killing Longuet was to tempt God. It was
the gravest responsibility.
</p>
<p>
However, he knew how to lead M. Longuet&rsquo;s mind quietly and without haste
to the subject of his death, and thus he prepared him for death.
</p>
<p>
He made him live his death the moment that he made him die his death.
Then, at the psychological moment, he made a certain gesture, the double
sign which precipitated in death the spirit of the dead, and brought back
to life the living mind.
</p>
<p>
These were the details of the operation to be performed, and the
preliminaries, which consisted in making Théophraste live through the last
months of Cartouche&rsquo;s life, having been started, M. Eliphaste began asking
Théophraste a series of questions. The latter was lying, groaning, on the
bed in the laboratory, which was lighted by the hissing scarlet flames.
</p>
<p>
M. Lecamus and Mme. Longuet sat on a low bench at one side of the room. M.
Eliphaste stood beside the bed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where did they take you, Cartouche?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;In the torture room. My trial is ended. I am condemned to die on the
wheel. Before the torture they wish me to confess the names of my
accomplices, my friends, my mistresses. I should rather die on the wheel
twice! They shall know nothing!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And now, where are you, Cartouche?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am going down a small stairway, at the end of the &lsquo;Walk of the
Pillory.&rsquo; I open a grating. I am in the dark cellars. These dungeons do
not frighten me. I know them well! Ah! Ah! I was shut up in that dungeon
under Phillippe le Bel!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Then with a terrible power M. Eliphaste cried out, &ldquo;Cartouche! Thou art
Cartouche! Thou art in the dungeons by order of the Regent.&rdquo; Then he
repeated to himself, &ldquo;Phillippe le Bel?&rdquo; and then to Théophraste again,
&ldquo;Where are we going? Where are we? My God! We must not lose our way! And
now where are you, Cartouche?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I advance in the darkness of the cellars. There are about me, walking in
the dark, so many guardsmen that I cannot tell the number. I see below,
far, far below, a ray of light that I know well. It is a square ray of
light that the sun has forgotten since the beginning of the history of
France. My guards are not French guardsmen. They mistrust all French
guardsmen. My guards are commanded by the Lieutenant of the Short Robe of
the Châtelet.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where art thou now, Cartouche?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am in the torture chamber. There are before me men clothed in long
robes, but I cannot distinguish their faces. They are my commissioners,
who have been entrusted with the verifications, as appeared to be the
custom. But why do they call it verifications? The thought makes me
smile.&rdquo; (Théophraste really smiled as he said this.) &ldquo;Where are you now,
Cartouche?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They put me on the criminal stool. They have put my legs in backings.
With incredibly strong cords, they have bound small planks about my legs.
I believe truly that the rascals wish to make me suffer to the limit, and
the whole day&rsquo;s work will be rough. But I have a heart hardened by
courage. They shall not break it!&rdquo; At this point M. Longuet, on his
strapped bed, uttered a fearful cry. His mouth was wide open, and he
groaned incessantly. Adolphe and Marceline leaned over him and asked with
horror when that howling would cease, and when that mouth would close. But
M. Eliphaste only said, &ldquo;The torture has begun. But if he howls like that
at the first blow of the mallet, there is going to be trouble.&rdquo; M.
Eliphaste was not expecting those groans. He paid no attention to the
howling. He calmed M. Lecamus and Mme. Longuet with a supreme gesture. He
spoke to Théophraste, something they never knew, for the howling prevented
them from hearing anything.
</p>
<p>
At last the howling became groaning, and eventually the groaning itself
stopped. Théophraste&rsquo;s face had become comparatively placid.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why do you cry out in that way, Cartouche?&rdquo; &ldquo;I scream because it is a
punishment that I cannot denounce my accomplices. I have their names on
the end of my tongue! They do not see that if I do not denounce them it is
because I cannot move the end of my tongue! I cannot! I cannot! I cannot!
And they struck with their mallet again! And they sunk the pieces of wood
into my legs again! It is unjust! I cannot move the end of my tongue!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What are they doing to you now, Cartouche?&rdquo; &ldquo;The doctor and the surgeon
are leaning over me and feeling my pulse. They are congratulating
themselves on having chosen that kind of torture, which is, they are
saying to the commissioners, the least dangerous to life and the least
susceptible to accidents.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And now, Cartouche, what are they doing to you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They are doing nothing to me, and I regret it, for they have decided to
bury the second wedge in me only a half hour after the first, and let the
pain which it produced pass away, and the sensibility be entirely
restored. I am looking at my judges. They have black mouths. I like the
face of the executioner better. He is no more amused than I. He wants to
be somewhere else. But there he comes with the second judge. They are all
around me. They are over me! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!...&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Never had Théophraste looked so terrible. His mouth was wide open, and his
tongue seemed paralyzed. Foam was around his lips, and his eyes seemed to
start out of his head.
</p>
<p>
M. Lecamus looked across to M. Eliphaste, who said, when the second howl
had died away, &ldquo;Why do you scream, Cartouche?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Because these torturers will not listen to the names that are on the end
of my tongue.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But you have not told us any names. You have only screamed.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is Cartouche they are torturing and Longuet who screams,&rdquo; answered
Théophraste.
</p>
<p>
M. Eliphaste was taken aback by this last response. He turned toward the
two silent onlookers and said in a low, trembling voice, &ldquo;Then it is he
who is suffering.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There was no room for doubting this truth. The fearful expressions on
Théophraste&rsquo;s face as he imagined the executioner forcing the wedge in,
showed too plainly that though it was Cartouche whom they tortured, it was
Théophraste who really suffered.
</p>
<p>
M. Eliphaste seemed very concerned. Never before had such a case come
before his astral scalpel. The identity of the soul had been proven, and
suffering Cartouche had cried out in distress after two centuries. This
cry had waited to come from the lips of Théophraste.
</p>
<p>
M. Eliphaste leaned his head on his hands and prayed. After a short
silence he turned to M. Lecamus and said, &ldquo;We are only at the second
wedge, and there are seven of them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you think my husband will have the strength to bear them?&rdquo; asked
Marceline.
</p>
<p>
M. Eliphaste leaned over the prostrate form of Théophraste and examined
his head, just as the doctor had done to Cartouche in the torture chamber.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The man is all right,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there is anything to
fear now. We must kill Cartouche.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I think so, too,&rdquo; said Lecamus. &ldquo;It is necessary for the future security
and definite happiness of M. Longuet.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
M. Eliphaste then continued his interrogations:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And now what are they doing to you, Cartouche?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They are questioning me. I cannot reply. Why doesn&rsquo;t that man in the
corner of the dungeon do his duty? I have not yet seen his face. He turned
his back to me and made a noise with old irons. The executioner is very
quiet. He is leaning against the wall, yawning. There is a lamp on the
table which gives light to two men, who write incessantly. Behind the man
who is making the noise I see a little red light. The executioner&rsquo;s
assistant has loosened the knots in the cords a little, which gives me a
relief for which I am grateful... But... but... but the assistant on the
other side pulls and pulls. If he continues to pull the cords so he will
cut my legs off. They bring a crucifix for me to kiss. Behind the man who
turned his back on me I hear something like crackling embers, and there
are small red flames which lick the stone walls. Between the two men who
are writing there is a man who makes a sign. The executioner has a kind
face. I sign to him for some water. I could bear the pain better if I had
not such a thirst. The executioner raises his mallet! I swear I cannot say
the names which are at the end of my tongue. They will not leave me. I
cannot speak! Oh! why cannot you hear them? Take them from me!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
By this time his mouth had become closed, but the lips were opened in such
a way as to make it appear that he had no lips. The teeth were locked and
welded together tightly. A muffled cry of suffering came from the throat,
but could not escape through the closed teeth. Suddenly there was a sharp
grinding, and his teeth began to break under the great pressure of that
closed jaw. Pieces of teeth were scattered over the bed, and blood issued
from his mouth. His horrible groaning continued, and Théophraste showed
signs of weakening under the great strain.
</p>
<p>
At this horrible spectacle M. Eliphaste declared wearily that he had never
assisted or suspected that he could assist at such suffering. He confessed
that until to-day he had never operated on a reincarnated soul of less
than five hundred years. It was obvious that in spite of all his science
and all his experience the illustrious medium was nonplussed.
</p>
<p>
M. Eliphaste did not try any longer to dissimulate his anxiety. He could
have stopped the operation there if he had had time. But they buried the
wedges in so rapidly that it did not even permit him to question M.
Longuet.
</p>
<p>
During this last performance M. Longuet&rsquo;s toothless mouth opened again.
Other cries issued from it which were not like human cries at all. They
were so curious and so weird that all three onlookers leaned over him,
trembling with terror to see how such a cry could be made by a human
mouth.
</p>
<p>
Mme. Longuet wanted to run away, but in her fright she fell. When she
arose the cries had ceased. M. Eliphaste commanded her to be quiet,
recalling to her with a severe look her responsibility in the operation.
</p>
<p>
M. Théophraste now reposed peacefully on his strap-mattress. That
peacefulness, following immediately the horrors of such suffering, was
extraordinary. He was not in pain. He remembered none of it. After the
torturing was over he ceased to think of it, and consequently this was how
he could reply to M. Eliphaste in the intervals of torture, in the most
natural way, without physical emotion.
</p>
<p>
M. Eliphaste again began to interrogate him:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And now where are you, Cartouche?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am still in the torture chamber. Ah! they hold me! They hold me
tightly! They hold my arms! What are they going to do? The man in the
center says, &lsquo;By order of the Regent we must have the names. So much the
worse if he dies for it! Are the tongs ready? Begin with the breasts!..
Oh! Oh! The man kneeling before the burning coals gets up, making a noise
with the irons. He hands the red tongs to the executioner. They uncover my
right breast! Oh! Oh! It is dreadful! I cannot live through it!&rdquo;

CHAPTER XX
</h2>
<h3>
<i>In the Charnel House</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE recital which follows is the integral reproduction of what came out
of the mouth of Théophraste while plunged in hypnotic sleep, from the
moment that he submitted to the torture until he died. This part is of the
highest importance, not only for the experimental spirit of science, but
for history, for it destroys the legend of the wheel and shows to us, in
an indisputable fashion, the real death of Cartouche. I have not found
this part stored in the oaken chest, but in the papers and statements
which have been read in the Spiritual Congress of 1889. It is all from M.
Eliphaste&rsquo;s hand.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste, or, rather, Cartouche in the power of M. Eliphaste, said, &ldquo;I
do not know exactly what has happened to me. I have died, I have hidden
the document, and I have not met a single person. When I re-opened my eyes
(I had them closed then, and I was without doubt falling from a feebleness
that seemed like death) I did not recognize at first a single one of the
objects which surrounded me, and I did not know the place into which they
had carried me. Certainly I am no longer in the torture room, nor in my
dungeon in the tower of Montgomery. Am I only in the Conciergerie again? I
do not know. Where have they imprisoned me after the torture, whilst
waiting for my death? Into what new prison have they thrown me? The first
thing that I distinguish is a bluish light which flitters across some
heavy bars which are covered with a grating. The moon visits me. It
descends two or three steps. I try to make a movement, but I cannot. I am
an inert thing. My will does not control my legs any longer, nor a single
one of my muscles. It is as if they had severed all relations between my
will and my flesh. My brain is no longer the master of seeing and
comprehending. It is no longer master of my actions. My poor legs! I feel
them scattered around me. I ought to have attained a degree of suffering-I
kneel on one, as I have explained, so that I shall not suffer more. But
where am I?... The moon descended two more steps, and then two more....
Oh! Oh! What is this that the moon lights? It is an eye! A large eye! But
the eye is empty; that large eye is empty, and the other eye at its
side-which is also lighted now-is covered again with its green eyelid. I
see the whole head! It had no skin on the cheeks, but it had a beard on
the chin. The moon advances continuously. It halts gently in the holes of
the nose. It has two holes in the nose, two on a head.... They threw me,
then, into a common ditch! The moon shone on me.... I have two legs of a
corpse across my stomach. I recognize those steps now, and this ditch, and
this moon.... I am in the charnel house of Montfançon!... I am afraid!...
When I went up to the Cleopimetes by the Bue des Morts on junketing days I
used to look at that charnel house through the grating. I looked at it
with curiosity because I already saw my carrion there, but the idea never
occurred to me that when a carrion was there it could look from the other
side of the grating. And now my carrion sees! They threw me there because
they thought me dead, and I am buried alive, with the corpses of the
persons hanged. My fate is entirely miserable and surpasses all that the
imagination of men could invent! The saddest reflections assail me, and if
I ask myself first of all, by what artifice of fate I am reduced to such
an extremity, I am obliged to confess that fate had nothing to do with
this affair, but my pride only. I should have continued quietly to be the
‘chief of all the robbers&rsquo; if I had remained alive. But La Belle Laittiere
was right when she said in the tavern of the Reine Margot that I was no
longer fit to live. I was pleased to play the potentate, and I ended by
having a mania for cutting up in pieces all those whom I suspected. My
lieutenants ran more danger in serving me than in deserting me. They
betrayed me, and that was logical. The beginning of my bad luck was the
affair of the Luxembourg. It should have opened my eyes, but my pride
hindered me from seeing clearly. This is a good time for these
reflections, now that I am in the charnel house.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am living in the charnel house with the dead, and for the first time in
my life I am afraid. But I am not afraid of the dead; I am afraid of the
living, for there is one near me alive! <i>I know that he moves</i>. It is
strange that at this moment, when I am upon the limit of life and death,
my senses perceive things that they ignored in good health, and while my
ears do not hear any more, on account of the boiling water with which they
were filled, I know there is some one alive near me. Shall I be then not
the only one to live in this domain of putrefaction? I recall that the
Vache-a-Paniers told me that the Count de Charalais had caused some women
who had resisted him to be buried alive in the little ditches near the
earthen mound of Montfançon, but I, Cartouche, have no desire to think of
such a crime. I know very well that he bathes himself in the blood of
young virgins whom he had killed, to cure himself of a terrible disease
which ate into his flesh, but to bury women alive in ditches, that I do
not believe. And yet there is on my left side a woman who moves in one of
the ditches. I do not hear her, I feel her. The moon had lengthened its
ray of light as far as myself. Its ray is divided into three by the bars
of the grating. This makes three blue bands, by which I see, first of all,
the hole of the eye, and the three holes of the nose, and then a wonderful
mouth, which sticks its tongue out at me. Then there are three bodies
without heads. In the left side of the third body I distinguish very
plainly the putrefied wound in which was buried one of the rings from
which the headless one was hanged. He could not be hanged by the neck, as
he had no head. As I do not feel the woman at my side in the ditch move
any more, I collect my wits a little and I employ myself in remembering
the bodies which fill the charnel house. I begin to see those which are
entirely in the shadows. There are some! There are some more sounds. They
bring all the executed criminals here from the city. There are some fresh
ones, there are some decayed ones, there are some well preserved ones, and
all dry; but the others are not presentable-they are falling into ruin. I
will soon be a ruin like them. However, all is not said, all is not
finished, since I exist. Hope is not dead. One finds hope even in the
depths of a charnel house. Oh, if I could move! The dead men are moving! I
will end by moving also. I have turned my eyes as far as it is possible in
the right corner of the orbit. I have seen that the corpse which is on my
stomach does not move its head. It slides on my stomach. I begin to be
afraid again, not because the dead one moved-for the charnel house belongs
to the dead, who do there what they wish, but because they pull the dead
man by the legs. I turn my eyes in the other corner. In the left corner I
saw a dead man&rsquo;s leg in the air. This leg ought to be held by something,
pulled by something. The moon rises the length of the wall, with the leg
as far as one of the holes. And my eyes look so much to the left that they
see a living hand. The living hand which came out of the hole holds the
dead foot. <i>I feel, I know that there is a woman eating</i> in the ditch
at the side. And now I cannot take my eyes from the hole for fear of
seeing the live hand come back and seeing it reach out. But I hope on my
salvation. I hope that the hand will not be long enough. Suddenly the moon
ceases to light up the hole, and I turn my eyes toward the grating where
the moonlight enters. Then I see between the moon and me a man on the
steps of the charnel house. A living man. I am saved perhaps. I wished to
cry out with joy, and I should have, perhaps, if the horror of that which
I feel and know all at once had not suddenly closed my throat. <i>I feel,
I know</i>, that that man has come to rob me of my bones!... On account of
the Courtesan Emilie!... The Regent is remembered with the Duke of Orleans
and Jean sans Peur.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Courtesan Emilie would not see him again. The devil meddled with the
affair, and carried a bone of Cartouche, who was beloved by Emilie, to
place in her bed between her chemise and her skin. I know this, my eye has
read this in the heart of the man who descends the steps of the charnel
house. He comes there to take my bones from me.... He lights a lantern. He
goes straight to my corpse. He does not see, then, that the eyes of my
corpse are moving!... He draws out from under his cloak-a steel blade
sharp and red in the rays from the lantern. He puts the lantern down, he
catches me by the shoulders and leaves me half sitting against the wall,
under the hole. He took my left hand with his left hand, and with his
right hand he buried the steel blade in my wrist. I do not feel the blade
in my wrist, but I see it. It turns around my wrist. It is going to cut
it, already it has detached it. Now I commence to feel the blade! Life has
come back into my wrist! Oh, yes, my wrist!... Oh, yes, my wrist!... One
last blow with the blade and my left hand remains in his left hand. Oh, my
poor wrist!... Yes! Yes! Yes! The life! The life! The life of a nerve! I
tell you that it sufficed for the life of a nerve! Oh! Oh! Oh! The man
howls and breaks his lantern with a kick. My hand is partly in the man&rsquo;s
hand, but by a great miracle of the ebbing life in my wrist, my hand, at
the moment it leaves my arm, has seized the hand of the man! And the man
cannot rid himself of my hand, which is stiffening in death, and which
holds him! Ah! he moves about, he shakes, he howls, he shakes my hand,
which holds him-which holds him. He pulls my hand with his right hand, but
he cannot free himself thus of the wrist of a dead man&rsquo;s hand! I see him
as he flees from the charnel house, howling, bounding over the steps in
the moonlight like a fool, like a madman, gesticulating with my wrist.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;At this moment, above my head, a hand that I do not see, but which I
feel, comes out of the wall and takes me by the hair! It pulls me, pulls
me by the head. Oh, to cry out! To cry out! To cry out! But how can I cry
out with those living teeth staving me in the neck and throat?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And now, Cartouche, where art thou?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I go into the darkness radiant in death.&rdquo;

CHAPTER XXI
</h2>
<h3>
<i>The Result of the Operation</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s soon as Théophraste had pronounced these words, M. Eliphaste made a
sweeping gesture with his right arm. He leaned over the prostrate form,
and blew impatiently on his eye.
</p>
<p>
He said to him: &ldquo;Awake thou, Théophraste Longuet!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This was repeated three times, each time with greater earnestness.
However, Théophraste never moved. His immobility was deathlike, and his
toothless mouth and bloodless lips made the silent onlookers believe that
he had followed Cartouche in the shadow of death. His corpselike pallor
seemed to them to be already turning green, and his hair, having become
suddenly white, gave him the appearance of a very old man. Was he already
dead? Was he decomposing already?
</p>
<p>
M. Eliphaste repeated the gestures, and in his lids, intense earnestness
appeared like a madman. He blew again on the eyes, and parted the
eyelashes, again crying out: &ldquo;Théophraste Longuet, awake thou! Awake thou,
Théophraste Longuet!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Just at the moment when they believed that Théophraste Longuet would never
return to life again, a slight tremble shook his frame, and drawing a deep
breath, he turned his face toward them. At first he breathed with
difficulty, but quickly recovering, he opened his eyes and said:
&ldquo;Cartouche is dead!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
M. Eliphaste&rsquo;s face lit up with emotion. &ldquo;Let us thank God,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;that the operation has been successful,&rdquo; and he began his prayer again:
&ldquo;In the beginning thou wast silent! Eon! Source of all ages!...&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mme. Longuet and M. Adolphe threw themselves on Théophraste, while
thanking God from the bottom of their hearts. They felt that the death of
Cartouche had not been too dearly bought. The operation had certainly been
a rough one, but he had only lost his teeth, and his hair had turned
white. Mme. Longuet put her arms around her husband, and helped him rise
from the couch. &ldquo;Let us go. We have stopped here too long already,&rdquo; she
said.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Speak louder,&rdquo; said Théophraste, with strange enunciation. &ldquo;I have
something in my ears. I cannot move, either.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is natural that you should be a little benumbed, my dear,&rdquo; said Mme.
Longuet. &ldquo;You have been stretched on that bed for a long time. But make an
effort.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Speak louder, I tell you. I can move my arms now, but I cannot stir my
legs. They won&rsquo;t move, and my feet pain me very much.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He then put his hand to his mouth and said: &ldquo;Why, what have you done with
my teeth? You put me to sleep to fix my teeth, and you have taken them
from me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was curious that while he was asleep, even after he had lost his teeth,
he spoke distinctly. It was evident that he could not move, and Mme.
Longuet removed the clothing to rub his stiff limbs. To her sorrow she
found his clothes all torn, and on looking closer saw all the flesh on his
limbs lacerated. His legs and feet were boiled. The flesh was torn away in
some places, and burned horribly in others. M. Eliphaste, with trembling
hands, removed the clothing from his chest, and there they saw, over the
heart, two spots of black blood. His biceps bore fresh marks of frightful
torture.
</p>
<p>
Mme. Longuet sobbed loudly, and sat with lowered head, looking at the
horrible sight. Adolphe ran to get a carriage. It was evident that
Théophraste could not walk or move. On his return, Théophraste was still
complaining of the pain. Adolphe, with the assistance of the carriage
driver, carried him out into the street. They lifted him carefully on the
mattress, and walked slowly out, followed by the weeping Marceline.
</p>
<p>
M. Eliphaste prostrated himself on the ground, and with his hands clasped
and elbows on the floor, cried out with a voice full of sorrow: &ldquo;My
beloved! My well beloved! I believed that I was Your son. Oh, my well
beloved! I have taken Thy shadow for Thy light. Thou hast crushed my
pride. I am in the dark, at the bottom of an abyss-I, the man of light-and
I have hated it. I am only the son of silence. Eon! Source of Eon! Oh,
life! To know life! To possess life!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And thus, as they went out into the pure air, they left him praying.

CHAPTER XXII
</h2>
<h3>
<i>Visits to a Butcher&rsquo;s Shop</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HEOPHRASTE&rsquo;S bones were not broken, and it only took six weeks to heal,
although he was obliged to keep to his bed for two months, when he
regained the use of his legs. During all this time he did not make a
single allusion to the past. Cartouche was dead-quite dead. The operation
had been successful, although very painful. So much so, that every one
dreaded that he would remain a cripple to the end of his life; but he had
recovered marvelously. He had obtained a new set of teeth, and was able to
speak quite plainly, but it was a more difficult thing to rid himself of
the effects of the boiling water in his ears, and at times he was
perfectly deaf.
</p>
<p>
After a while Théophraste thought of occupying his mind by going back into
business. He had retired when young, being able to live on the income
derived from several inventions which he had made for the use of rubber
stamps.
</p>
<p>
However, they were all very thankful for the result, and this slight
inconvenience did not worry them.
</p>
<p>
It was his habit to rise early, and after breakfast he would go out for a
little walk to strengthen his legs. He soon found their old elasticity,
and regained their full use. On these occasions Adolphe used to follow a
short distance behind in order to watch his movements and report to M.
Eliphaste.
</p>
<p>
At first he noticed nothing abnormal in his behavior, and in his report
contented himself with stating this unimportant fact, that he stopped
quite a while before a butcher&rsquo;s stall. If this had occurred only once, it
would have passed the watchful Adolphe unnoticed. However, it became a
regular thing for Théophraste to stand looking at the bloody meat, and
spend some time talking to the butcher, a square-shouldered, florid
fellow, always ready with a jest.
</p>
<p>
One day, when M. Lecamus had decided that Théophraste had spent too much
time at the butcher&rsquo;s shop, he came up to him, as if by chance, and found
him, with the butcher, decorating all the fresh meat with curl papers.
This was innocent enough. Thus judged M. Eliphaste, although he wrote in
the margin of the report:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He may look at the meat in the butcher&rsquo;s shop. It is good to let him see
blood sometimes. It is the end of the crisis, and can do no harm.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This butchery was a small one, and had its specialty. M. Houdry sold among
other ordinary meats a special quality of veal. The secret of this quality
lay in the way it was killed. The majority of Paris butchers obtain their
meat from the abattoirs, but M. Houdry always bought his alive, and killed
it himself, in his own way. He was not satisfied to knock the calf in the
head, as they did at the abattoirs. He bled it after the Jewish manner,
with a large knife which he called the bleeder, and so dexterous had he
become in this art that he never had to cut the same wound twice. He had
gained some reputation as a good butcher.
</p>
<p>
M. Houdry had explained the case about his veal to M. Longuet, with the
greatest mystery, and he had evidently taken great pleasure in it- so much
so that Théophraste, after having listened to the theory, had shown the
desire to assist at a practical lesson. In a small court adjacent to the
store, M. Houdry had a secret abattoir. On a certain morning, Théophraste,
who happened there at a much earlier hour than was his custom, found his
man at the abattoir with a calf. The butcher begged him to come in, and to
close the doors behind him. &ldquo;I shut myself up every day thus with a live
calf,&rdquo; said M. Houdry, &ldquo;and when the doors of the abattoir are opened
again, the calf is dead. I lose no time; I have operated in twenty-five
minutes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste congratulated him. He asked him many questions, interesting
himself in all the objects which struck his attention. The bellows with
its large arms drew his attention. He also saw a windlass. He learned that
that strong oak cross-bar, with pegs in it, supported the windlass and the
bucket. He admired the solid oak hand-barrow also. A chopper which was
drawn up was called a &ldquo;leaf.&rdquo; But that which interested him more was a set
of tools hung on the walls in the shop. In this &ldquo;shop,&rdquo; which was sort of
saddle-bags for cutlass, he saw first of all the bleeder, and was pleased
to pass his finger over the long, strong and sharpened edge. Then there
was a much smaller knife, called the &ldquo;Moutoniner,&rdquo; used ordinarily to cut
up mutton, as the name indicates, but which was used there to cut certain
parts of veal. Then some other small knives, among which was the canut,
used in &ldquo;flowering&rdquo; the veal. &ldquo;Flowering&rdquo; the veal consists in making
light, artistic designs on the shin of the veal, as soon as it is
bleached.
</p>
<p>
The first day M. Longuet received instructions about the tools. But in the
following days he learned the art of the whole operation, and entered into
each detail with little repugnance. He used to say, some days, in going
away, jestingly: &ldquo;You kill a calf every day; you must be careful, my dear
M. Houdry, you see it will end by its becoming known to the other calves.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste was not idle, either. Whenever he had an opportunity he would
help M. Houdry in these killings. One day the assistant did not come, and
Théophraste helped rope up the calf for killing. As he was doing this, M.
Houdry remarked on the evil of killing the calf by striking him on the
head, as they did at the abattoir.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste declared it was a crime, and most inhuman. &ldquo;It is much finer
to do it with the bleeder. One blow is sufficient, and the head is off.
What a fine death. How the blood flows, and with what dispatch does he
die.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Théophraste, who had killed the calf, &ldquo;see the calf&rsquo;s eyes, as
the blood flows. How they stare at you. They are dead, but they look at
you!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What is the matter with the calf&rsquo;s eyes?&rdquo; demanded M. Houdry. &ldquo;They are
like the rest. Ah, you think it is a joke? Well, well, you are not so used
to it as I.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
M. Houdry then prepared the meat for selling, and while he was doing so
Théophraste took the head, cleaned it and cut out the eyes. The sight of
the blood had excited him beyond control, and M. Houdry was amused when he
desired to take the head and feet home with him.
</p>
<p>
In parting he said: &ldquo;Au revoir, M. Houdry, au revoir. I will take the head
away with me, but I leave you the eyes. I do not like eyes to stare at me.
You must not laugh at me, though. You do not understand me. However, it is
my affair, and you must be glad that you are not afraid of dead eyes
staring at you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And so he returned home, and when he appeared at the door of his house
with the calf&rsquo;s head under his arm, Adolphe and Marceline smiled, saying:
&ldquo;He is amusing himself with some innocent prank.&rdquo;

CHAPTER XXIII
</h2>
<h3>
<i>A Newspaper Report</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T had become their habit in the Longuet flat to play dominoes in the
evening. M. Adolphe was a good player, and always he used the Norman
provincial names. When he played the double six, he would call the &ldquo;double
negro&rdquo;; the five was &ldquo;the dog that bites,&rdquo; and so on. Marceline was always
amused by these terms, and was always ready to play.
</p>
<p>
It happened on this particular evening that Théophraste lost his game, and
after a short argument he began to sulk, and refused to play more. Seating
himself in a chair near the window, he began reading the paper. He had
strong political opinions.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly he was attracted by a strange headline. He read it and re-read
it, and could not resist an exclamation. &ldquo;Strange! Is not Cartouche dead,
then?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He could not help smiling. This hypothesis was so absurd. Then he ran over
the first lines of the article and said: &ldquo;My dear Adolphe, have you read
this article? &lsquo;Is not Cartouche dead, then?&rsquo; It is a strange, a surprising
article.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Adolphe and Marceline could hardly prevent a start, and looked at him with
uneasiness.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste began to read the article aloud, as follows:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;For some days the police have been occupying themselves with one of the
greatest of mysteries that have occurred in Paris, and with a series of
odd crimes. They are endeavoring to hide from the public the most curious
sides. Those crimes and the manner in which their perpetrator escapes from
the police at the moment they think they have him, recall, point by point,
the manner in which the celebrated Cartouche committed his crimes. If he
was not enacting a thing so reprehensible, one could admire the perfect
art with which the model is imitated. It is Cartouche to a finish! The
police themselves have never dealt with a more mysterious bandit.
Nevertheless, the administration, very mysteriously, but, we admit, very
intelligently, has sent by some of them an abstract of Cartouche&rsquo;s
history, compiled from the manuscripts of the National Libraries. They
thought, subtly, that the history of Cartouche would be useful to them,
not only in the present task, which is to prevent the criminal outrages of
the new Cartouche, and to arrest him, but also that Cartouche&rsquo;s history
ought to form a part of the general instruction to all the agents of
police.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Finally the news was brought to us that M. Lepine, Prefect of Police,
has ordered them to devote several evenings in the Prefecture to listen to
lectures on the authentic history of the illustrious bandit.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you say to that?&rdquo; demanded Théophraste with merriment. &ldquo;It is a
merry farce, and the journalists are great fellows to issue such fibs.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Neither Adolphe nor Marceline smiled. Marceline&rsquo;s voice trembled slightly
when she begged Théophraste to continue. He began to read again quietly:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;The first crime of the new Cartouche did not at all present the horror
that we shall find in some of the others. It was a polite crime. Let us
say at once that all the crimes of which we have any knowledge, and which
they attribute to the new Cartouche, have been accomplished in the last
fifteen days, at the North, and always from eleven o&rsquo;clock in the evening
to four o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mme. Longuet rose, very pale. M. Lecamus made her sit down again, by a
knowing shake of the head, and commanded her to be silent.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste said: &ldquo;What is this that they want to tell with their new
Cartouche? As for me, I only know the old one. After all, let&rsquo;s see the
gallant polite crime,&rdquo; and he read it over more and more calmly:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;A pretty woman, well known in Paris, where her literary salon is
frequented by all those who interest themselves with debates and with
matters spiritualistic, was proceeding, toward morning, with her toilette
for bed, and preparing to take a well-earned rest, following the fatigue
which had wearied her that evening there with the disorder of a conference
at home of the most illustrious of our pneumatics, when suddenly the
casement of her balcony was opened quickly by a man with a figure a little
over the medium, still young and vigorous (this last is in the report of
the police), but with perfectly white hair. He had in his hand a brilliant
nickel revolver.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;"Madame,&rdquo; said he to the terrified woman, &ldquo;compose yourself. I do not
wish to do you any evil. Consider me the most humble of your servants. My
name is Louis Dominique Cartouche, and I have no other ambition than to
sup at your side. By the tripes of Mme. de Phalaris, I have the hunger of
all the devils!&rdquo; and he began to laugh.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Mme. de B.-let us call her Mme. de B.- believed that she was dealing
with a crazy man, but he declared he was only determined to take supper
with her, which peculiar favor he had long desired. That man was much more
dangerous than a crazy man, for it might be necessary to kill him on
account of the brilliantly nickeled revolver.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;"Go,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;and call your people, and tell them to bring here
to you a good supper. Do not give them a single explanation which would be
likely to cause me any embarrassment or trouble, for if you do you will be
a dead woman.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Mme. de B. then took her departure, for she was brave, with a mind
sufficiently elevated to enable her to face the most unexpected
adventures. She rang for the chambermaid, and a quarter of an hour later
the man with the white hair and Mme. de B. were seated opposite each other
in proper style, and apparently the best of friends. The supper was
prolonged through the night (we do not wish to affirm anything as to this
point, which is so interesting-but are a little skeptical as to the
veracity of this story), so that the man did not descend by the sheet from
the balcony until about sunrise. The beautiful Mme. de B. had not had
supper, and so she did not complain about that forced supper, which she
ended by partaking of in very good grace, nor had she seen the necessity
of reporting her adventure to the Police Commissioner. And we see what
the circumstances were. Some days later the Commissioner was announced at
Mme. de B.&rsquo;s. He told her that the ring that she wore on her finger, in
which a magnificent diamond glittered, was the property of Mlle. Emily de
Bescancon. Mme. de B. was of course ignorant of its value-or where it came
from. It had been presented to her. But Mlle. Emily de Besancon, who had
seen it on the finger of Mme. de B. the day before at a charity sale,
claimed it formally as hers. She had furnished all sorts of proofs of it,
and the diamond was set in such a unique way that there could be no doubt
of it. Mme. de B. was infinitely troubled, and was obliged to relate the
adventure which had befallen her. She spoke of the unknown, of the
balcony, of the supper, of the gratitude he had shown her for his supper,
and his placing the magnificent diamond on her finger, which he had
obtained, he said, from a woman he had loved very much, a Mme. de
Phalaris, who had been dead for some time. Mme. de B. could not be
suspected. She furnished a proof-the nickel-plated revolver that the
unknown had left on the table that night. Finally she begged the
Commissioner of Police to take away from her house the hundred bottles of
champagne of every choice brand that the unknown had sent to her the day
after the eventful night, under the pretext that the supper had been
exquisite, and that the only thing that could have been desired was
champagne. She feared that the champagne, as well as the ring, had been
stolen. The Commissioner acquitted the beautiful Mme. de B. He could do
nothing at the time, the news being in everybody&rsquo;s mouth, as the world at
large would henceforth interest itself in the new Cartouche.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;This little adventure, which is the least important of those we have to
relate, is the reproduction of what happened on the night of the 13th of
July, 1721, at the house of Mme. la Maréchale de Boufflers. She also was
occupied in making her toilette. The young man, who came unexpectedly by
way of the balcony, had no revolver in his hand, but he carried six
English pistols. He demanded supper after presenting himself as Louis
Dominique Cartouche, and the widow of Louis François, Duke of Boufflers,
peer and Marshal of France, one of the heirs of Lille and of Malplaquet,
supped with Cartouche, and late at night.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Cartouche only complained of the champagne, and Mme. de Boufflers
received a hundred bottles of it the next day. She had them taken, by her
butler Patapon, into the cellars of a great financier.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Some time after that one of Cartouche&rsquo;s bands stopped an equipage in the
streets of Paris. Cartouche leaned into the carriage to recognize the
faces. It was Mme. la Maréchale de Boufflers. He turned toward his people.
&ldquo;Give them liberty to pass on, now and always, Mme. de la Maréchale de
Boufflers!&rdquo; ordered he in a ringing voice, and he bowed very low to the
Maréchale, after he had slipped on her finger a magnificent diamond that
he had probably stolen from Mme. de Phalaris. <i>Mme. de Phalaris never
saw it again</i>.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Now let us pass on to the crime in the Rue du Bac.&rsquo;&rdquo;

CHAPTER XXIV
</h2>
<h3>
<i>The Murder in the Rue Guenegaud</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ARCELINE got up as much to hide her feelings as to find out if the
nickel-plated revolver was in its usual place in the drawer. Upon her
return she was greatly agitated, and told them that the revolver had been
removed.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste advised her to calm herself, saying there was nothing of
importance in that; and he proceeded to read about the crime in the Rue du
Bac, saying that the journalist who wrote the narrative was more
intelligent, and had made his report more interesting than the first one.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;However,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there are a few inaccuracies and omissions in his
narrative. According to him one is led to think that Cartouche indulged in
amorous proceedings with Mme. de Bithigne after supper. However, such a
thing should not be allowed to get abroad, as no such thing happened. He
had no other intention than to take supper with the lady.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, my dear Marceline, if I had intended otherwise, my reputation would
have suffered, and Mme. la Maréchale de Boufflers would have scorned me
when I met her on July 13th, 1721.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;These gentlemen also relate that I outraged Mme. la Maréchale de
Boufflers. This is all wrong. I am very fond of her on account of her
intellect, and our intercourse was most polite, as well as virtuous. If
they had only studied more, these journalists would have known that Madame
in 1721 was over sixty years old, and I dare say Cartouche knew many
younger women to play such tricks on.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste then took up the paper:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;The history of the Rue du Bac is much more simple. The Prefect of Police
had received a note which ran: &ldquo;If you dare, come and find me; I am always
at the inn in the Rue du Bac, with Bernard.&rdquo; It was signed &ldquo;Cartouche.&rdquo;
 The thing had occurred after Mme. de Bithigne had told her story. The
Prefect thought over his case and laid his plans.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;That same evening, a quarter of an hour after midnight, half a dozen
policemen raided the tavern in the Rue du Bac. They were met on the stairs
by a man, who, although still young, had perfectly white hair. He was
endowed with almost superhuman strength, and, on seeing the police, he
picked up a chair near by and started striking them. Three of them were
stunned, and the others only just had time to drag the prostrated bodies
of their companions into the street to prevent them from being burned by a
fire started on the first landing by this man with white hair. The man
saved himself by jumping from roof to roof over spaces more than thirty
feet high.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;The new Cartouche,&rsquo; continued Théophraste, amid the scared silence of
Marceline and M. Le-camus, &lsquo;the new Cartouche has taken possession of the
Rue Guenegaud. Several days ago they found in a vault-like passage there
under the floor the body of a young doctor, who had been active at the
death of Mme. de Bardinoldi, the mystery of which had baffled the police
and press. The police had not confided to any one the fact that pinned to
the young doctor&rsquo;s tunic was a card on which some one had written in
pencil: &ldquo;We will meet each other in the other world, M. de Traneuse.&rdquo; This
was without doubt a crime of the new Cartouche, for the old one did in
fact assassinate at this place an engineer named Traneuse. Cartouche had
knocked him on the head with a stick, and the young doctor had had his
skull fractured with a blunt instrument.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste laid down the paper, and, looking at Adolphe and Marceline,
remarked that they both looked as if they were expecting a like
catastrophe.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, my dear Adolphe,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is ridiculous for you to be angry at
such pleasantries. I take the opportunity of telling you that I often
frequent the Rue Guenegaud. That history of M. de Traneuse was to me the
beginning of one of the prettiest farces that ever I played with M.
d&rsquo;Argenson&rsquo;s spies. Following the death of M. de Traneuse (who had allowed
some very improper talk about me), I was followed by two patrols of the
guard, who covered me and rendered all resistance impossible. But they
were ignorant that I was Cartouche, and satisfied themselves by conducting
me to the Ford l&rsquo;Avegne, which was the easiest prison in Paris. In this
prison they put debtors, drunks, and disorderly people, and the people who
have not paid their fines. They were sure that they had taken Cartouche on
the 10th of January, but on the evening of the 9th Cartouche had made his
escape, and took the direction of his police. It was time, for everybody
was now searching the streets of Paris.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear Marceline, and my dear Adolphe, you look as if you were at a
funeral. That article does not lose its quota of a certain amount of wit.
At first I thought it only the jest of a cheap journalist, but I see now
that it is very serious, believe me. Wait for the history of the calf! Ah!
We have not done yet with the affair of the Petits Augustines! Listen!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste picked up his paper, adjusted his gold spectacles, and began
again:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;That which was the most extraordinary in this adventure was that several
times during light days they have been on the point of capturing this
modern Cartouche, and that he always escaped just as the other did, by way
of the chimneys. History teaches us that the true Cartouche designed on
the 11th of June, 1721, to sack the Hotel Desmarets, Rue des Petits
Augustines. It was one of his men, Le Ratichon, who had given him the
idea. But Cartouche and Le Ratichon had been imprisoned by the police. As
soon as Cartouche was in the house, the bailiffs hastened there and the
place was invaded. He tranquilly closed the doors of the salons and
extinguished the lights, undressed himself, climbed into the chimney,
descended by another way into the kitchen, where he found a scullion,
killed the scullion, disguised himself with the dead man&rsquo;s clothes, and
went out in fine form from the hotel, killing two bailiffs with two pistol
shots because they asked him news of Cartouche. Well, what will you say
when you know that our Cartouche was surrounded the day before yesterday
in a confectioner&rsquo;s shop in a quarter of the Augustines, escaped by the
chimney, after having put on over all his effects, to prevent soiling
them, the pastry cook&rsquo;s blouse, which had been found on the roofs, also
his pantaloons. As to the pastry cook, they found him half buried in his
bake oven. But, before putting him there, as a humane precaution, the
murderer, Cartouche, had assassinated him.&rsquo; &rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Here Théophraste, interrupting himself again, cried:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Previously, previously. I had previously assassinated him.... But why do
you fly into the corners? Are you afraid? Let us see, my dear Adolphe, my
dear Marceline, a little coolness- you will need it for the history of the
calf.&rdquo;

CHAPTER XXV
</h2>
<h3>
<i>The Calf&rsquo;s Revenge</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>EVER had Mme. Longuet or M. Lecamus been so upset before at the reading
of a newspaper. The account of the atrocious murder did not seem to
disturb Théophraste a bit. When he came to the part where Cartouche had
placed the baker in the bake oven, Mme. Longuet groaned and could not sit
still. M. Lecamus was no less disturbed, and they both rose and looked to
Théophraste in amazement.
</p>
<p>
He then began to read the account of M. Houdry&rsquo;s calf:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;M. Houdry was a head butcher on one of the small streets. Everybody came
to him to buy veal, which was his specialty. This report explained itself
by a fact so unusual that we can believe it only on the affirmation of M.
le Commissioner of Police Mifroid, who conducted the first inquest. We
know that all the butchers of Paris get their meat from the abattoirs. It
was against the law for them to kill anything at home.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is accurate,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;that is exactly right; M. Houdry
explained that to me several times, and the confidence that he placed in
me by telling me the mystery of his abattoir astonished me not a little.
Why should he confide to me a fact which was not known to his wife, his
private clerk, a foundling whom he considered as one of the family, and
his brother-in-law, who brought the calf to him each night? Why? Ah! No
one knows. Perhaps it was because he couldn&rsquo;t help it. You know very well
that no one can escape his fate. As for me, I said to him: &lsquo;Take care, you
might end by being one of the calves!&rsquo; I resume my reading: &lsquo;That calf was
brought to him secretly each night by his brother-in-law, and as his
abattoir was on a little court, behind which was the open country, no one
ever saw a live calf at M. Houdry&rsquo;s.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;The inquest will tell us from whence the calf came. M. Mifroid, the
Commissioner of Police, has decided to sift the matter to the bottom, and
penetrate the whole mystery.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;It appears that M. Houdry had his special way of killing his calf, a way
that gave quality to the veal. He used to cut the calf&rsquo;s throat with a
bleeder.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is it necessary for me,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;to show you what a bleeder
is?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Going to the drawer of the sideboard, he took out the carving knife, and
while explaining that a bleeder was twice as large as that, he passed it
up and down M. Lecamus&rsquo; face to make him understand the method of killing
the calf. He tried to get M. Lecamus to hold the knife, but by this time
he was too frightened, and had retreated into a corner of the room,
fearing that Théophraste would do something violent. However, he laughed
at their temerity and sat down to read the further account.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Yesterday, leaving early, monsieur shut himself in his abattoir as usual
with his calf. He was aided by his clerk in tying the calf to the hanger.
The calf being tied, the clerk busied himself in rinsing the casks before
the abattoir, which the butcher always kept shut when killing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Ordinarily, M. Houdry took from twenty to thirty minutes to kill his
calf, gut it and bleach it. Thirty-five minutes passed, and the double
doors of the abattoir were not opened. The clerk, who had finished
rinsing, noticed it with the greatest astonishment. Often M. Houdry had
called him to scald the head, scrape the hairs off, and clean the ears.
That particular day his master did not call him. Meanwhile, Mme. Houdry,
the butcher&rsquo;s wife, appeared at the door of the court.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;"What isthe matter there?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Is he not finished yet?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;"It is true, madame, he is a very long time.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Then she called, &ldquo;Houdry! Houdry!&rdquo; No response. She crossed the court
and opened the abattoir door. The calf immediately escaped, and began
gracefully jumping around her. She looked at the calf at once with
emotion, for at that time the calf should have been dead. Then she struck
a single blow on the double door, and called again to her husband, who did
not answer her. She turned toward the clerk. &ldquo;M. Houdry is not there,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Are you sure he has not gone out?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;"Oh, madame, I am perfectly sure of it. He has not come out and no one
has gone in. I have not left the court,&rdquo; replied the clerk, springing at
the calf&rsquo;s head as it continued running around. &ldquo;I am sure he is there. He
is just hiding to frighten you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;"It will be better to hide the calf. Houdry! Houdry!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;The clerk, with a turn of the halter, had tied the calf. Entering with
Mme. Houdry he uttered a cry of surprise and said: &ldquo;Oh, that is queer!
When we came in there was only one calf, a single calf, madame, a calf
which was tied to the hanger, and which gambols in the court now, and here
is another calf on the crossbeam.&rdquo; Yes, indeed, there was another calf on
the tinel.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;"I see it now,&rdquo; said Mme. Houdry. &ldquo;What a small calf! But you are
foolish; there should be two calves.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;"Never, madame, never.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;"Well, you see perfectly the calf on the beam?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;The little clerk and Mme. Houdry drew near to the beam, which was in the
shadow, and how astonished they were to see the kind of white meat which
was hanging from the beam. They had never seen such white meat, and this
meat was arranged exactly like the calf&rsquo;s. They accounted for this finally
by deciding that it was not veal meat.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;"What a curious calf,&rdquo; the clerk continued to repeat.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;"It is not a small calf,&rdquo; said Mme. Houdry. &ldquo;No! no!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;"All the same, madame, they have decorated the skin on the stomach with
the lancet. See!
</p>
<p>
What pretty patterns! There are two hearts, some arrows, some flowers
...Ah! those beautiful flowers.&rdquo; The clerk raised up the lungs from which
hung the heart.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;"It is a beautiful pluck,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and has not been trufled. The heart
is good.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;"Yes, he had a good heart!&rdquo; groaned Mme. Houdry, who was all at once
terrified at what she had said.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Thereupon the clerk began to weep, and without knowing why, dipped his
hands in a pail of cold water which was placed beside the boiler, looking
for the head of the animal, and he drew out a head. But when she saw the
head, Mme. Houdry fainted, for she had recognized the head of her husband.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Mme. Houdry had immediately recognized her husband&rsquo;s head, and the clerk
himself examined it more closely, to be sure that it was the head of his
master. It was a well-cut head-well refined, well scalded, well scraped.
The moustache and hair had been shaved, as they should be, and but for
something unforeseen, if need be, the head of the butcher would have
passed for the head of a calf.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;The clerk in his turn fainted, and let the head of M. Houdry roll away.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Some minutes later the tragedy was discovered, judging from the
disturbance in the quarter.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The journalist,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;was not of the opinion that the calf
had decapitated the butcher, and that also was put before Cartouche&rsquo;s
name-that poor Cartouche.&rdquo; He shrugged his shoulders once more, and then,
having raised his eyes above the paper, he sought in the two corners of
the dining-room, where M. Lecamus and his wife had taken refuge. They had
disappeared. He called them and they did not answer. He tried to open the
door of the landing, and it would not open. He then rushed to the chimney,
which was large enough for him to get up, and scaled it with the same
facility as he had descended the chimney when the boiler was beginning to
boil at M. Houdry&rsquo;s, the same morning that he had decapitated that
unfortunate man.

CHAPTER XXVI
</h2>
<h3>
<i>Théophraste Again Hears of His Treasures</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE clamber over the roofs of the Rue Ge-rondo on a cold rainy night had
a physical and moral effect on Théophraste. He had taken cold and was
suffering in consequence. From a moral point of view it had made him
change his whole view of these events. While he had been reading the
accounts of these crimes with which the new Cartouche had been terrifying
Paris, he had shown a callous indifference, but now he commenced to hold
himself responsible for many of the atrocities, and especially for the
murder of M. Houdry, which he had before facetiously blamed on the calf.
</p>
<p>
He often recalled nocturnal visits by the route he was now following, and
several bloody crimes came back to his memory, disgusting him, and making
him weep bitter tears of useless remorse.
</p>
<p>
It was, however, too late. In spite of all his sufferings, in spite of M.
de la Nox&rsquo;s invocations, and the torture they had submitted him to,
Cartouche was not dead.
</p>
<p>
And that evening, then, like many other criminal evenings, he led his
damned soul over the roofs of Paris. He wept. He cursed that mysterious,
irresistible force, which from the depths of centuries commanded him to
kill. He cursed the influence which made him kill. He thought of his
wife-of Adolphe. He bitterly regretted the hours of passed happiness
between those two beings so dear to him. He excused them for running away.
He pardoned them for their terror. He resolved never again to trouble
their peaceful days with his bloody incoherencies. &ldquo;Let me disappear,&rdquo; he
said to himself. &ldquo;Let me hide my shame and my original defect in the midst
of the desert. They will forget me. I shall forget myself. Let me profit
by these logical moments, when my brain, released momentarily from the
Other, discusses, weighs, deduces, and concludes and sees in the present.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was not Cartouche who spoke, it was Théophraste, who cried to
Cartouche: &ldquo;Let us fly! Since I love Marceline, let us fly! Since I love
Adolphe, let us fly! One day they will be happy without me! There is no
longer happiness with me! Adieu! adieu! Marceline, adored woman, faithful
wife! Farewell, Adolphe, precious, consoling friend! Farewell! Théophraste
tells you farewell!&rdquo; He wept. Then he said aloud: &ldquo;I come, Cartouche!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Then he plunged into the darkness, going from gutter to gutter, from roof
to roof, sliding from high walls with safety, protected, like a
somnambulist, by Providence.
</p>
<p>
And now who is that man who, with his head lowered, his back curved, his
hands in his pockets, swayed like a poor wretch in the wind and rain which
fell profusely all the tedious way? He followed the road which skirts the
railroad. It is a straight road, bordered by small, weak trees, plain
common broom-straw-sad ornaments for a departmental road-running along the
side of the railroad. Whence comes this man, with his hands in his
pockets, or, rather, this shade of a man? The plain extends to the right
and the left without an undulation, without the rising of a hillock,
without the hollow of a riser. All this can be seen, for this is not a
night scene; it is broad daylight, on the track, straight on by the side
of the road.
</p>
<p>
Trains pass each other from time to time, local trains, fast trains,
freight trains, rattling along with an occasional ceasing when one hears
in the wind the ting, ting, ting of the bell of the disks at the station.
There is one station before, and one behind. They are small stations, and
are five kilometers apart. Between the two stations there is a straight
double track, but no viaduct, no tunnel, no bridge, not even a culvert.
</p>
<p>
As I said before, from whence came the sad shade of a man?
</p>
<p>
It is Théophraste. He has resolved to fly-no matter where-far from his
wife.
</p>
<p>
After a night passed from gutter to gutter, not knowing where to direct
his steps, and not caring at all, he goes into a railway station. He gets
into a train without a ticket, gets out of the train at another station.
</p>
<p>
How often does it happen that the control registers of railway stations
are badly made on account of the number of travelers.
</p>
<p>
Behold him, then, on the road at the entrance of a village which follows
the railroad track. And who is it that watches him as he crosses the
threshold of a little house at the entrance of a village?
</p>
<p>
Mme. Petito herself!
</p>
<p>
It was the first time that Mme. Petito had seen M. Longuet since he cut
off the ears of her husband. Upon seeing him, Mme. Petito became highly
indignant, and commenced upbraiding Théophraste.
</p>
<p>
After all sorts of imprecations-the result of the barbarity of
Théophraste-Mme. Petito informed Théophraste that Signor Petito had found
the treasures of the Chopinettes, that he had put them in a safe place,
and that the treasures were the richest on earth, treasures which were
worth more than two ears. They were as good as the ears of Signor Petito,
and so they were quits.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste, in the course of this discourse, found it difficult to say
very much, but this did not disturb him. He was glad of the anger of Mme.
Petito, for having furnished him with such valuable information, and he
said: &ldquo;I have found my treasures, for I have found Signor Petito again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mme. Petito burst into satanic laughter.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Signor Petito,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;is in the train.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;In which train?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;In the train which will pass under your very nose! It will carry my
husband beyond the frontier. Get in, then, my dear monsieur; climb in if
you wish to speak to him. But hurry, for he passes by in an hour, and they
do not distribute tickets at the next station,&rdquo; and her laugh became more
satanic still, so much so that Théophraste almost wished that he was deaf
again. He saluted her and walked away rapidly along the railroad track.
When he was alone he said: &ldquo;Come, come! I must get some information about
my treasures from Signor Petito himself. But how? He is in the train which
will pass under my nose...

CHAPTER XXVII
</h2>
<h3>
<i>The Express Train&rsquo;s Disappearance</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T is necessary now for us to relate the extraordinary events which
happened on the railway. At this part of the track, which is double, there
were two stations about four miles apart, through which the express trains
ran quite frequently. In the evening after Théophraste had been speaking
to Mme. Petito, the express train had passed through the first station,
and the station master was waiting for the signal from the second station,
when suddenly a message came through saying that the train had not arrived
yet. The station master could not understand it. The train had passed
through his station fifteen minutes before, and would not have taken all
that time to go the short distance to the other station. He went out and
looked up the track. There was no sign of the train, and all was quiet.
Again the signal came back, and the second station master said that he
would walk along the track to see if he could find the cause of the delay.
The first man said he would do the same, and they both started running
down the track, followed by other men in the stations. Although it was
broad daylight, nothing could be seen of the train, and the two parties
met on the track. The first station master was greatly agitated, and wrung
his hands in despair. He knew the train had passed through his station. He
was sure of it. The report of his assistant confirmed it. Where could it
have disappeared to? The excitement and fear was too much for him, and
without any warning he fell dead at their feet with heart failure.
</p>
<p>
The men ran hither, thither, on both sides of the tracks, but no sign of
the train was there. At last they gave up the search, and placing the dead
body of the station master on a rough bier of sticks and leaves, they made
their way sadly back to the station.
</p>
<p>
They had not gone far when one of the party cried out: &ldquo;Look ahead,
there&rsquo;s the train!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And there, a few yards outside the station, on the very track they had
traveled on, was a wagon and baggage car of the disappeared train!
</p>
<p>
They were all very astonished, and were running, shouting, toward the
train, when they suddenly stopped. Peering out of the doors of the train
was a peculiar head. It had no ears, and appeared as though the door had
been shut violently, catching the man&rsquo;s neck. They called to him as soon
as they saw him, but he did not answer. The head just swayed from one side
to the other, rocked by the wind, which was blowing in great gusts. Upon
the head was curly hair, and the cravat around the white neck was untied,
floating in the wind.
</p>
<p>
On approaching, they saw the door of the coach was covered with blood, and
on examination saw that the man&rsquo;s head was held to the door by a piece of
rag. He had evidently opened the door and poked his head out, when
somebody must have shut the door again and decapitated him. The two men
who carried the dead body of the station master uttered a cry of dismay,
and placing their burden on the track, made an examination of the trucks.
They found no one in the first one, and opening the door of the second,
found that it was empty save for the dead man&rsquo;s body, which had been
stripped of all its clothing.
</p>
<p>
The news of this fantastic horror spread rapidly in the villages on the
road, and an enormous crowd gathered at the little station.
</p>
<p>
The police were sent for, but they were unable to get any clue as to who
the strange man was, or where the train with all its travelers had gone
to.
</p>
<p>
They were, however, very quiet about it, and only at the inquest did the
facts become known.
</p>
<p>
As it has been said, the tracks between these stations contained no bridge
or tunnel, but ran through a flat, desolate country, marked by no hills.
The only thing to break the line of the track was a short side line which
ran into a disused quarry, which had been used as a sand quarry by a
glassmaker. This had been abandoned many years ago, and had not been used
since.
</p>
<p>
On looking at the plan one would at once think that the presence of this
branch line was an explanation of the train disaster. But this was not so,
as subsequent events will prove. In fact, so simple a solution of the
problem would soon have been discovered by the station men.
</p>
<p>
Wandering along the road which followed the track, Théophraste had noticed
the little side track, and he had seen that the switch had been left
unlocked. This would have had no significance to him before he had the
interview with Mme. Petito, but now he saw an excellent opportunity of
getting at Signor Petito, who was on the train. He of course could not get
on the train while it was in motion. He would open the switch and wait for
the train to come up. The engineer would be sure to see it and stop his
train. Here was his opportunity.
</p>
<p>
This was simple enough, and he did as he intended. He turned the switch,
and, going along the track, hid behind the bushes to await the express. He
waited and waited for a long time, but no express came. He became
impatient, and looked up and down the track, hoping to hear it, or see its
smoke.
</p>
<p>
However, after half an hour, he rose, and, although tired of waiting, went
down the track to see what had happened. He had gone about half the
distance to the station, when he met a train-fitter who was going along
the track to look for the train. Asking him what had become of the train,
he turned back up the line, and arriving at the point where he had been
hiding, he discovered the baggage car and carriage which were to be found
a few minutes later by the trainmen from the station.
</p>
<p>
In his astonishment he asked how they could have got there without passing
him. He had not left the track, so it could not have passed him.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly he saw the head of a man at the carriage door; the head had no
ears, and so he quickly recognized it as that of Signor Petito. He climbed
up into the carriage, all excitement, and searching the carriage, suddenly
had an idea. He would disguise himself in Signor Petito&rsquo;s clothes! He
quickly undressed, and stripping the dead body of all its clothes put them
on, and tied his own up in a bundle. He then descended from the carriage,
and fumbling in the pockets of the dead man&rsquo;s clothes, drew out an old
pocketbook. He became feverishly excited as he searched through the
papers, seeking some trace of his treasures. But he found nothing, and he
found it difficult to hide his disappointment, for Signor Petito had
carried the secret of the treasure to the grave.
</p>
<p>
Mme. Petito was unable to give him any information, for soon after hearing
of her husband&rsquo;s death she became insane, and remained so to the end of
her days.

CHAPTER XXVIII
</h2>
<h3>
<i>Not To Be Explained!</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>S Théophraste was searching through the pocketbook of Signor Petito, he
had wandered unconsciously away from the track into the fields. Upon
returning, he was astonished to find the carriage had disappeared. He
looked up and down the track, but could find no trace of it. Which was the
most astonishing, the disappearance or the apparition of the train? He
could not make it out, and the events had thrown him into a state
bordering on prostration.
</p>
<p>
He went down the track, examined the switch, and put it back in its
original position and locked it, taking the key with him.
</p>
<p>
He walked on to the upper station, but with the exception of the signalman
everybody had gone out in search of the train. He interrogated him, but
could only learn that the train had been reported but never came.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste insisted. &ldquo;They certainly did report the express to you from
the preceding station?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir. I am certain. Look at my signal. It is still put to allow the
train to pass. The station master and all the men of the station preceding
saw the express pass and telegraphed to us. In short, monsieur, you see my
little yellow arm. A catastrophe between the preceding station and this
one is not possible; there is not a single bridge or viaduct. I was
mounted on the ladder that you see leaning against that great vat. From
there one can see the whole line, as far as the other station. I saw our
people gesticulating on the line, but did not see the train.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Strange, very strange!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, indeed. You must trust my little yellow arm.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Inexplicable.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is nothing more inexplicable.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There are things more inexplicable still than that which have happened.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What, then?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A carriage without a locomotive appeared and disappeared, and no one
could tell from whence it came. It disappeared, as it appeared.... Did you
not see a carriage with a man at the door pass by here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the signalman angrily, &ldquo;you mock me! You are exaggerating
because you do not believe the story of the express which did not come.
But look, monsieur, at my signal; that is proof enough. It cannot make a
mistake.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
M. Longuet replied to the signalman: &ldquo;If you did not see the express,
neither did I.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In that &ldquo;neither did I&rdquo; commenced the inward thoughts of M. Longuet, who
went away in Signor Petito&rsquo;s clothes. M. Longuet had an idea. His
misfortune was so extreme and so incurable that he resolved to die for the
others. With a little cunning this was possible, since he had reclothed
himself in Signor Petito&rsquo;s clothes. Nothing would hinder him from leaving
his on the bank of the first river he came to.
</p>
<p>
This would constitute a suicidal act, according to the law.
</p>
<p>
M. Longuet was moved to the thought of addressing a letter to Marceline
and Adolphe. On the banks of what river would he put his clothes? How
could he re-enter Paris? However, these thoughts passed through his head
momentarily, for there was only one thing which was really of importance
to him, and that was the explanation of the disappearance of the train.
</p>
<p>
This explanation was given to Théophraste by M. Mifroid, under the
circumstances which we shall now report.

CHAPTER XXIX
</h2>
<h3>
<i>M. Milford Recognizes Cartouche</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>T midnight an artisan was singing in a square in Paris, at the side of
the ancient Quarter d&rsquo;Enfer, the hymn which several months later became so
popular, the &ldquo;International.&rdquo; That artisan was working with several
companions repairing the track, which had sustained certain damages,
following the construction of a new drain. The track was bent in certain
places, and even a house in that situation, a heavy new house of seven
stories, was leaning. The city engineers were much concerned by this state
of affairs. They knew that in this quarter the catacombs projected their
innumerable tunnels, their thousands of drains, and that certain buildings
were in a very precarious state.
</p>
<p>
There are ancient Gallic-Roman quarries under those tottering walls, and
so they determined on some work to make these houses secure.
</p>
<p>
The day which interests us saw the end of this work. The artisan who sang
the &ldquo;International&rdquo; had, with his companions, completed the stopping of a
hole in the subterranean vault that they had previously strengthened with
very heavy pillars, several meters high.
</p>
<p>
It was just about twilight when they relinquished their work, and the
workman who sang the &ldquo;International&rdquo; had almost finished stopping up the
hole at that hour.
</p>
<p>
At the same hour, not far away on the square, in front of an electrical
lamp store, a few people stood about on the pavement, and M. Mifroid was
buying a few lamps for his men. He had paid for them and was just leaving
the store with his package, when he saw in front of the store a young man
with white hair. He was so taken aback that he slipped into his pockets,
without having paid for them, several electrical lamps. Always courageous,
M. Mifroid bounded toward the man, crying: &ldquo;It is Cartouche!&rdquo; He had
recognized him, for since the revenge of the calf, all the commissioners
of police had the portrait of Cartouche in their pockets. We should add
that Mme. Longuet herself, and M. Lecamus, immediately after the reading
relative to the calf, had shut M. Longuet up, with the design of sending
an urgent communication to the nearest Commissariat.
</p>
<p>
Then M. Mifroid, who had known our hero as Théophraste, when he had dined
with him, and who recognized him as Cartouche, cried out in bounding
toward him: &ldquo;It is Cartouche!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste had known for days what the police wanted with him, and when
he saw Mifroid and heard the words &ldquo;It is Cartouche!&rdquo; he said to himself:
&ldquo;It is time for me to get out of this.&rdquo; And he ran down the street.
</p>
<p>
The commissioner ran on behind him, and was just grabbing him by the
collar, when they both fell down the hole which the workman was filling.
</p>
<p>
The man had left for a few minutes to drink with his companions at the
saloon near by, and on his return he completed his work, not knowing that
the two men had fallen, and so they were imprisoned.

CHAPTER XXX
</h2>
<h3>
<i>M. Mifroid&rsquo;s Theory</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN M. Mifroid recovered sufficiently from the shock of his fall, the
first thing that worried him was that he would be &ldquo;out of the game.&rdquo; Even
at the moment of his fall his presence of mind did not fail him, and he
knew that he was falling into one of the thousand-year-old quarries, which
crossed under Paris in their intricate meanderings. He experienced that
feeling accompanied by a light, painful torpor which follows a swoon
caused by shock.
</p>
<p>
He was in the catacombs!
</p>
<p>
His first thought was to try and find the lights which he had just bought,
and so find out how the passage lay. He felt sure that they must have
fallen through the hole with him. The darkness seemed to weigh heavily on
his eyelids, and a great feeling of depression came over him. Without
getting up, for by an imprudent movement he would lose the knowledge of
the exact place where he had fallen, he spread his hands about him and was
relieved to find his package again. He feared at first that the lamps
would be broken, but soon felt that it was not so; and breaking open the
package, he pressed the button on one of the lamps. The cavern was lighted
with a fairy brightness, and he could not keep from smiling as he thought
of the unfortunates who, shut up in some cavern, generally drag themselves
along, holding their breath, behind a paltry snuff of a candle, which at
any moment might flicker out.
</p>
<p>
He got up then and examined the vault. He knew of the work of repairing
the track, and knew that they neared the end, but when he saw that the
hole through which he had fallen was closed, a feeling akin to fear came
over him.
</p>
<p>
Now some meters of earth separated him from the outside world, unless it
was possible for him to get up to this place which they had filled in. He,
however, flashed his light around, and after surveying the walls and the
vaults, he came across a prostrate body. The sight at first gave him a
shock, but on examination he found it to be the body of M. Longuet-the
body of the new Cartouche. He examined it and noticed that it did not bear
a single trace of serious wounds. The man was stunned, as he had been
himself, and without doubt he would not be slow in coming out of that
swoon. He recalled that M. Lecamus had presented him to his friend in the
Champs Elysées, and behold, he was now mixed up with him like the worst
kind of assassins.
</p>
<p>
Just then M. Longuet breathed a sigh, stretched his arm, and complained of
some pains. He arose, and, saluting M. Mifroid, asked him where they were.
M. Mifroid told him. He did not seem at all distressed, but drawing forth
his portfolio, he traced some lines which resembled a plan, and showed
them to M. Mifroid, saying:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;M. le Commissioner, we are at the bottom of the catacombs. It is an
extraordinary event. How we are going to get out I do not know, but that
which is distressing me most at the present moment is what has happened to
the express train.&rdquo; M. Mifroid demanded some explanation, and M. Longuet
related to him, with the closest detail, the disappearance and
re-appearance of the carriage and the train. For the better understanding
of the track he drew a plan out as follows:
</p>
<h3>
A H D C B
</h3>
<p>
This he showed to M. Mifroid.
</p>
<p>
He explained how the train had disappeared between A and B. How he had
turned the switch at H and waited at D for the train to pass on to the
side track. He described how the train had never come, and how the
carriage had appeared and disappeared.
</p>
<p>
M. Mifroid became greatly interested, and begged him to repeat the story.
&ldquo;And when did this happen?&rdquo; asked he. &ldquo;It has not yet been reported to
me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It happened several hours ago,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;and it should have
been reported by now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
M. Mifroid examined the plan for about five minutes, and after reflecting
for a while, asked Théophraste a few questions. Suddenly he burst out
laughing and said: &ldquo;Why, what a difficult problem. I have solved it in
five minutes.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You said there were five men at A and five men at B. It passes through B,
but not A. You were at D, and because you did not see, it did not pass?
Consequently, your train vanished. Well, I say the train exists between A
and B, and must be somewhere between B and I, that is sure; the train is
in the sandhill.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I swear not!&rdquo; said Théophraste. &ldquo;I was at D expecting the train, and I
did not leave the track.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It can be nowhere else, for five men saw it pass B and the five men at A
are equally certain it didn&rsquo;t pass them. Therefore I say that as only you
were at D it passed that point, and undoubtedly switched off on I, since
it could not be otherwise. By a necessary chance, while the first cars of
the train were engulfed in the sand hillock, which covered it up (imagine
that the line H is too short for the engineer to have had time to avoid
the accident), the yoke chain of the last car was broken, and so the last
carriage was forced by the baggage car to descend as far as D, on the
track, which was slightly up-grade, since it wrent into a sand hillock.
Then after going down to H and back to D, you saw the carriage and Signor
Petito in the doorway. Your Signor Petito opened the carriage door,
perhaps to throw himself out, as soon as he was aware of the imminent
catastrophe, and as the latter caused a shock, it closed the door on the
head of your Signor Petito.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now, having despoiled Signor Petito of his clothing, you walk into the
fields to read his papers. When you return the carriage is no longer
there. Now, then. Since there was a declivity, and since there was a wind,
the carriage, after having rolled as far as H, is found on the line A-B,
where the trainmen certainly have found it by this time. Do you understand
now? Do you understand all except that you did not see the train pass D?
You are deaf sometimes, M. Longuet?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have already had the honor of telling you so.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Imagine that you were deaf while you were waiting for the train at D. You
did not hear then?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, but I should have seen it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Already you did not hear it. That is much. Possibly you turned your head
for three seconds. Three seconds, that is to say, one second and thirty
hundredths longer than is necessary to see an express train of four
carriages pass before you, which, being late, made 120 to the hour. M.
Longuet, the train disappeared, or, rather, seemed to disappear, because
you were deaf and turned your head for a brief space of time.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
M. Longuet raised his arms to the limit toward the vaults of the
catacombs.

<h3>
<i>Lost in the Catacombs</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN M. Longuet had recovered from the emotion that M. Mifroid&rsquo;s
explanation of the train had caused him, he went through his pockets and
handed over to M. Mifroid a revolver and a large knife that he had found
in Signor Petito&rsquo;s pocket.
</p>
<p>
He was now perfectly rational and felt free from the influences of
Cartouche. He, however, dreaded the return of these fancies, and asked M.
Mifroid to accept these articles in order to defend himself should he
again be possessed with this evil spirit.
</p>
<p>
Continuing the search through his pockets, he produced seven lamps like
those of M. Mifroid, and so between them they had thirteen of these
lights, which would give them 520 hours of continuous light. They,
however, worked out that they could do ten hours a day without light on
account of sleep, and their calculations gave them fourteen hours of light
per day.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;M. Longuet,&rdquo; said M. Mifroid, &ldquo;you are wonderful. Cartouche himself could
not have done better; but what is the good of carrying them around with
us? They will only be a nuisance. Are you hungry, M. Longuet? How long do
you think you could remain without food?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;that I could remain this way forty-eight
hours.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, you will have to remain like this for seven days, perhaps. I will
throw these ten lamps away, as after the third one I am afraid we shall
not have much need of the rest.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked M. Longuet. &ldquo;No matter where,&rdquo; answered his
companion; &ldquo;but we must go anywhere rather than stay here, for there is
not a ray of hope here. We will reflect while walking. Walking is our only
salvation, but by walking seven days we will risk all chance of arriving
anywhere, unless we make a plan.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why not make an exact plan?&rdquo; asked M.
Longuet.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Because I have observed in all the stories of the catacombs there were
always marked plans which the unfortunate wanderers have lost. They were
confused by the marked places, and not understanding anything about it,
they became overwhelmed with despair. In our situation it is necessary to
shun all causes for despair. You are not without hope, M. Longuet?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, by no means, M. Mifroid. I will add, even, that were I not so hungry,
your pleasant society aiding, I should not at all regret the roofs of the
Rue Gerondo. You must tell me some stories of the catacombs, M. Mifroid,
to let me forget my hunger.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, certainly, my friend. There is the story of the &lsquo;Jailer,&rsquo; and the
story of the &lsquo;Four Soldiers.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;With which will you begin?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am first going to tell you of the catacombs in general; this will make
you understand why it is necessary to walk a long time to get out of
them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Here M. Longuet interrupted him, asking why in ending his sentences he
always made a gesture with the thumb of his right hand.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That means, M. le Commissioner, that the gesture has become a habit with
you-putting on thumb-screws?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
M. Mifroid declared that that was not the reason. He often gave himself up
to sculpture, and he explained to him that it was the habit of a modeler.
He buried his hand in his discoveries, just as he did in his clay.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
M. Longuet expressed astonishment that a police commissioner should
interest himself in sculpture. However, it afterward transpired that M.
Mifroid&rsquo;s knowledge of this art was the means of their final escape from
the catacombs.
</p>
<p>
M. Mifroid, in reporting, the events of the catacombs, wrote as follows:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The way that we were following was a vast passage of four or five meters
high. The walls were very dry, and the electric light which lit our way
allowed us to see a hard stone, devoid of all vegetation, even of
moisture. That proof was not one to rejoice M. Longuet&rsquo;s heart, for he was
beginning to be very thirsty. I knew that in the catacombs there were some
threads of running water. I thanked heaven for not putting us on one of
these threadlike streams, for we should only have lost time in imbibing
there, and, moreover, as we could not carry away any water, it would only
have made us more thirsty.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;M. Longuet objected to the idea that we were walking without caring
where. I resolved to make him understand the necessity of walking on
anywhere, in relating to him that which was the truth, that the engineers,
when repairing the track, had descended into the catacombs, and had sought
in vain to discover their limits, and to find an outlet they were obliged
to give it up, and they built those pillars as supports, and built the
arch with masons&rsquo; materials; they descended directly into the hole, before
closing it finally over our heads. Not to discourage M. Longuet, I
informed him that, to my knowledge, we could count on at least 520
kilometers of catacombs, but there was not a single reason why they should
not have had more. Evidently, if I had not warned him immediately of the
difficulty of getting out of there, he would have manifested his despair
the second day of the walk.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I think, then,&rsquo; I said to him, &lsquo;that they have dug this soil from the
third to the seventeenth century. For during 1400 years, man had removed
from under the soil the materials that were necessary to construct above.
If at any time there was not enough above, there was always more below.
That above returns below, and goes out thence,&rsquo; and as we still found
ourselves under the ancient Quarter d&rsquo;Enfer, I recalled to him that in
1777 a house in the Rue d&rsquo;Enfer was swallowed up by the earth below. It
was precipitated to 28 meters below the soil in its court. Some months
later, in 1778, seven persons met death in a similar caving in. I cited
still several more recent examples, dwelling upon the accident to persons.
He understood, and said to me: &lsquo;In short, it is often more dangerous to
walk above than below.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I kept on, seeing that he was impressed, and he spoke no more of his
hunger, and forgot his thirst. I profited by it to make him lengthen his
step, and I burst into the most entrancing song which came into my mind.
He took it up, and we sang in chorus:
</p>
<p class="indent15">&ldquo;&lsquo;Au pas, comerade, au pas,
</p>
<p class="indent20">La route est belle!
</p>
<p class="indent15">J&rsquo;aura du frictiti la bas,
</p>
<p class="indent20">Dans la gamelle!&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was this which made him keep step.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;One gets tired of singing very quickly in the catacombs, because the
voice does not carry; so when we had got tired M. Longuet asked a hundred
more questions. He asked me how many meters there were over our heads. I
told him that that could vary, from the latest reports, from 5m.82 and 79
meters. Sometimes, I told him, the crust of earth was so thin that it was
necessary to extend the foundations of the tombs as far as the bottom of
the catacombs. So that we might, in the course of our peregrinations,
encounter the pillars of Saint Sulpice de St. Etienne du Mont, of the
Pantheon of the Val de Grace, of the Odeon. These monuments are erected in
some way on the subterranean pilings.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Really, in the course of our peregrinations we risk encountering some of
these subterranean pilings.&rsquo; But he had his own fixed idea.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;And in the course of our peregrinations, is there any chance of our
coming upon an exit? Are there many ways out of the catacombs?&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;There are not,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;there is need of them. First of all, there
are egresses into the quarter.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;So much the better,&rsquo; he interrupted.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;And other ways out that some know of, but by which none are ever
admitted, but which exist, nevertheless, in the caves of the Pantheon, in
those of the College of Henry IV, of the Hospital of the Undi, of some
houses in the Rue d&rsquo;Enfer, of Vangirard, of the Tombe Issoire at Passy, at
Chaillot, at Saint Maur, at Clarenton, at Gentilly-more than sixty. In
order to safeguard building construction, an ordinance was made which
closed all the openings to the catacombs.
</p>
<p>
It is that ordinance, my dear M. Longuet, which has almost walled us in.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;At that moment we struck an enormous pillar. I examined its construction,
and said without stopping: &lsquo;Here is a pillar which was used by the
architects of Louis XVI in 1778, then of the Consolidation.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Poor Louis XVI!&rsquo; said M. Longuet. &lsquo;He had better have consolidated
royalty.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;M. Longuet had taken the electric lamp from my hands, and did not cease
to throw the rays to the right and left, as if he was looking for
something. I asked him the reason of this, which would fatigue the eyes.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I am looking for some corpses,&rsquo; he said.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Some corpses!&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Skeletons. I have heard that the walls of the catacombs are hung with
skeletons.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, my friend&rsquo;-I already called him friend, his serenity in such a
serious emergency delighting me so much-&rsquo;that ghastly tapestry is only a
little longer than a kilometer. That kilometer justly called an ossuary,
on account of the skulls, the radius, the cubitus, tibias, shin-bones,
phalanges, the thorax, and other small bones which were made into unique
ornaments. But what ornaments! Ornaments of three million skeletons, that
were brought from the cemeteries and acropolis of Saint Midard Clucy,
Saint Lamdry of the Carmelites, the Benedictines, and of the Innocents.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;All bones, the little bones well sorted, arranged, co-ordinated,
classified, labeled, which made on the walls and in the cross passages,
roses, parallelopipides, triangles, rectangles, volutes, crevices, and
many other figures of marvelous regularity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Let us wish, my friend, to reach that domain of the dead. It will be
life. For there there are always a number of people. It is much
frequented. But we are not there. What is one kilometer of dead men&rsquo;s
bones in five hundred?&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Clearly! How many kilometers do you think we have made, M. Mifroid?&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;We have made nine.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;What are nine kilometers in five hundred?&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I induced M. Longuet not to make these useless calculations, and he
begged me to tell him the story of the &lsquo;Jailer&rsquo; and that of the &lsquo;Four
Soldiers.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That made two histories which were not very long in telling. There were
only a few words in the first. There was once a jailer of the catacombs
who became lost in the catacombs. They found his corpse eight days later.
The second related to four soldiers of the Val-de-Graces, who were
descending, by the aid of a cord, into a well of eighty meters. They were
in the catacombs, and as they did not reappear some drummers were sent
down, who made the greatest noise that they could with their drums, but in
the catacombs sound does not carry, and no one responded to the rolling.
They hunted, and at the end of forty hours they found them dying in a
blind alley.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;They had no moral courage,&rsquo; said Théophraste.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;They were foolish,&rsquo; I added. &lsquo;Whoever is foolish enough to wander into
the catacombs deserves no pity.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We were by this time come to a crossway, and M. Longuet turned to ask
which way we would follow.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I could answer him without delay. I said:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Here are two galleries; which are you going to take? One goes almost
directly back to our starting-point, the other directly away from it.&rsquo; As
our design was to go away from our starting-point, M. Longuet showed me
the first gallery.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I was sure of it!&rsquo; I exclaimed. &lsquo;But you disregard the entire principle.
The experimental method has for centuries demonstrated that at the bottom
of the catacombs all individuals who wish to come back to their point of
setting out (to the entrance of the catacombs) go away from it; then the
whole logic of it is, to go away from one&rsquo;s point of starting out, one
must take the way which apparently brings one back to it.&rsquo; And so we
decided on the gallery which seemed to us to bring us back over our steps,
so we were sure of not having made a useless trip. That system was
excellent, for it led us into a certain region of the catacombs that no
one had visited before, since the fourteenth century, otherwise it would
have been known.&rdquo;

CHAPTER XXXII
</h2>
<h3>
<i>A Dissertation on Fish</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>. LONGUET had from the first been complaining of his great hunger. He
was getting very weak, and the end of the thirty-sixth hour saw him
cursing their misfortune. However, what would have been the good of a
little food? They were buried alive, and food would have been like a buoy
to a shipwrecked sailor, alone in the middle of the ocean. It could only
serve to prolong the agony.
</p>
<p>
M. Mifroid was more philosophical. He said that if there had been anything
to eat to give them strength to continue their way, he would have been the
first to suggest their stopping. But, with the exception of some
mushrooms, probably poisonous, that his watchful eye had seen, there was
nothing, so he urged M. Longuet to tramp on. M. Longuet, however, was
unreasonable; he said he was hungry, and yet did not seem able to exert
himself to get out of the catacombs.
</p>
<p>
He asked M. Mifroid question after question as to the catacombs and what
he could eat to stay his terrible hunger. M. Mifroid tried to keep him
interested by telling him of a visit he had made to the laboratory in the
catacombs of M. M. Edwards. He told him of the fauna and the flora in
obscure and cavernous places, of which, if necessary, he could make a
meal.
</p>
<p>
Although the conversation was in vain, as far as its effects on
Théophraste were concerned, M. Mifroid kept on. Hungry men are always
eager to talk of things to eat, and although he didn&rsquo;t wish to acknowledge
his hunger, he spoke of these things, and in endeavoring to put spirit
into Théophraste allayed his own feelings.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said he to Théophraste, &ldquo;it may be that even if we don&rsquo;t
get out of the catacombs we will not die of hunger. There is a stream
somewhere here, and I have heard that there are certain fishes therein.
They are not large fish, but there are incalculable quantities of them.
They are of different sizes, and are not unpleasant to taste.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you seen them?&rdquo; asked Théophraste.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; but my friend, M. Edwards, told me about them when I visited the
Fountain of the Fanaisetan.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is that far from here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you just now-all that I know is that this fountain was
constructed in 1810 by M. Hericourt de Thury, engineer of the subterranean
quarries. This fountain is inhabited by the cope-podes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are they fish?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, they present some very singular modifications of tissues and
colorative. They have a beautiful red eye. That is why they are called
cyclops. That this fish has only one eye ought not to astonish you, for
the asellus aquaticus, which lives as well in the running water of the
catacombs, is a small isopode aquatic, which often has no eyes at all.
Many species have, instead of an eye, only a small red pig snout; others
have not a trace of one. They do not need to see clearly, since they live
in darkness. Nature is perfect, and never found wanting. It only gives
eyes to those who can use them, and does not give them to those to whom
they are unnecessary.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Théophraste was struck by M. Mifroid&rsquo;s words.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if we continue to live in the catacombs we will end by
not having eyes!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Evidently we will commence to lose the use of our sight and eventually
become blind.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Then Théophraste insisted upon M. Mifroid continuing his talk on these
fish that could be found in the catacombs, and which they would, perhaps,
have to eat. He was thus induced to give a sort of lecture on the
modifications of the organs, and their excessive development, or their
atrophy, following the ways frequented by individuals.
</p>
<p>
He continued: &ldquo;So the fish of which I speak have no eyes. Their sense
organs present modifications. For instance, the asellus aquaticus, even of
the normal species, is armed with small, flat organs, terminated by a
pore, that are considered olfactory organs. They are veritable olfactory
cudgels, and these very fish which do not see know the space around them
as well, possibly better, than if they could see in the light, so
perfectly developed are these olfactory and tactile organs. Yes, my dear
Théophraste, there are circumstances in the lives of some living things
where the nose takes the place of the eyes, and the nose can thus acquire
perfectly incredible dimensions. In the wells of Padirac there was found
an asellide which possessed olfactory cudgels of an amazing length.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are there none in the running waters of the catacombs?&rdquo; demanded
Théophraste.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, none at all. Yet there are found many sorts of cavernical fish, such,
for example, as the niphugus puleamus, and this is found in great
abundance. Their ocular organs are atrophied.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This, however, did not interest Théophraste, who had got his own idea.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you know how they fish for them?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I cannot say,&rdquo; said Mif roid; &ldquo;but we can surely get some sort of bait
from the surrounding vege-matter.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In a little while they both fell asleep, dreaming of this water which was
to bring them relief. However, though their dreams were pleasant enough,
there were surprises for them when they awoke.

CHAPTER XXXIII
</h2>
<h3>
<i>The Meeting of the Talfa</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HEY had been sleeping on a soft soil or decayed vegetable matter, the
sight of which had drawn from M. Mifroid the remark that it was a good
omen for the near future. Their travels up to the present had been without
incident, except for some differences of opinion between them. The
subterranean galleries, lit up by the electric lamps, were sometimes vast,
sometimes straight, sometimes rounded out like the vault of a cathedral,
then square and regular, and so narrow that they had to crawl on their
knees to get through. They had by this time become silent, except for a
remark or two upon the variety of the strata they were passing through.
Here was rock, here clay, here sand, and so on.
</p>
<p>
It could not, however, last much longer. For forty-eight hours they had
been walking, without coming across any water. M. Mifroid, however, hoped
on, and we will soon see how justified he was. He hoped at least to come
across some water or vegetation.
</p>
<p>
They estimated it to be about four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, when
Théophraste rose, and, tightening his belt, prepared to start on another
tramp. This time he did not speak of his hunger or thirst, but walked on
in that silence which weakness brings on men. They had been walking about
an hour when it was noticed that the temperature had become much higher,
and they both involuntarily took off their coats. Soon the perspiration
began to pour off their foreheads, and they began to wonder how this
change could have come about. Were they going toward the center of the
earth? How could it be accounted for? In two hours the temperature had
risen from 60 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. M. Mifroid knew of some galleries
79 meters below the ground, but who could estimate what depth they were at
now?
</p>
<p>
Their electric lamps spread their brilliancy around them as they advanced,
now discussing the cause of this phenomenon. Suddenly the walls of the
galleries spread out, and they found themselves in a cave of such large
dimensions that even with their strong lights they could not see the
farther ends. What was their joy and amazement when they found before them
a beautiful lake, the banks of which were covered with a thick carpet of
moss, and in the crystal transparency of which they saw fish with
beautifully colored scales. The fish had no eyes, and did not appear
timid. They disported themselves in the water, coming quite close to where
the two astonished men stood. They could easily catch them by leaning
over. A flock of ducks were swimming about in the enchanted water.
</p>
<p>
M. Théophraste wept with joy on seeing this wonderful sight, and cried out
softly, for he was afraid of disturbing them: &ldquo;My friend, what did I say?
Isn&rsquo;t this better than all earthly scenes?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
M. Mifroid felt somewhat humiliated at not knowing this before, but soon
regained his influence over Théophraste, who was beginning to get excited
over this wonderful sight. He made him sit down on the bank, so as not to
frighten the ducks, and began explaining to him that what they saw was
quite natural. He explained that it was caused by the soil, and that the
water had collected here by the action of the heat.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste was for throwing himself into the water at once, and would
have done so if they had not suddenly seen a sight which riveted them to
the very ground. Neither of them spoke. Their tongues were paralyzed.
Their electric light revealed, far ahead of them, but not far enough for
them to lose a single detail, the figure of a woman. She was quite naked,
and had her back toward them. Never before had they seen a form so elegant
and so graceful.
</p>
<p>
This first view, however, lasted only an instant, for she threw herself
into the water and swam away with the grace and ease of a swan.
</p>
<p>
The apparition had the effect of making them forget the ducks, and they
both forgot the hunger which gnawed at their vitals. They had hoped that
she would not vanish, and that their presence would remain unnoticed.
</p>
<p>
After several plunges, the nymph, shaking the pearly drops from her
beautiful body into the sleeping waters, emerged not far away from where
they stood, but always with her back turned.
</p>
<p>
What quarry of Carrara ever gave to the world more precious or purer a
marble? By what miracle of the divine fires can we contemplate those lines
of definitive beauty? It was the form of a Greek statue, and her arms were
as graceful as one could wish to imagine on the Venus de Milo.
</p>
<p>
They waited in silence for her to turn around, while she disported herself
on the green moss. Soon their curiosity was satisfied, and she suddenly
turned. Neither of them could restrain a cry of horror, which made the
Venus plunge back into the water. She had no eyes, and there was nothing
in their place. Her ears, which were hidden from their sight by the
profusion of hair, stood out like horns. But that which terrified them
most was her enormous, snout-like red nose.
</p>
<p>
They had hardly recovered from their first surprise when another young
female, clothed in a light tunic, came unexpectedly on the bank, holding
in her arms a long gown. She also had a nose like the other, and no eyes.
</p>
<p>
The Venus came toward her companion on the bank, and the latter said:
&ldquo;They are silent now, and not saying a word.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ha, Saint Mary, they shall have no pardon! They are traitors. Do you know
what our people are doing? Go and find out; I want to know.&rdquo; She spoke in
the purest French of the fourteenth century, and the delicacy and
sweetness of her voice was like the rippling water of a brook. The two men
watched and listened in amazement. They stood still and stared before
them. They felt that a great miracle was being wrought.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly they were surrounded by thirty or more men, who seemed to have
come from out of the very rocks. They stood around them, gesticulating and
talking vehemently, but in very low voices. They too had no eyes, but
their ears were developed to a surprising size. On each of their hands
they had ten fingers, and they had ten toes to each foot. As they came
into the glare of the electric light, they held their hands up to their
red snouts, as if they had smelled a disagreeable odor. They all mumbled
in half-audible tones: &ldquo;Lady Jane de Montfort, Demoiselle de Coucy,&rdquo; and
it was easy to see that they referred to the ladies who had been
disturbed. As they passed they felt the faces of the two men. They just
touched them lightly, and in doing so moved away in an apologetic way. It
seemed as if they were curiosities. They felt their eyes, their noses, and
their ears, and some of them even put their fingers down their ears. It
was evident they could not understand the smallness of their features.
</p>
<p>
Then one of them addressed M. Mifroid, and while apologizing for their
curiosity, said he was astonished at their want of beauty.
</p>
<p>
By this time Lady Jane de Montfort and Demoiselle de Coucy were dressed,
and M. Mifroid and M. Théophraste were presented to them.
</p>
<p>
The two men begged a thousand pardons for their intrusion, and were about
to explain their intrusion, when Demoiselle de Coucy took Théophraste by
the arm, and Lady Jane took M. Mifroid, and they were conducted through
the vaults surrounded by the crowd of men. It was difficult for them to
prevent the men from poking their eyes out as they fumbled over their
faces.
</p>
<p>
They had been forty-eight hours without food, and their hunger was
extreme, and now they were to be taken away from where there was food.
</p>
<p>
The two women had taken possession of their lamps under the pretext of
being troubled by the odor.
</p>
<p>
They tried to tell the people that they were exhausted, but so many
questions were put to them that no opportunity presented itself.
</p>
<p>
They had by this time reached a large chamber. There was a dull light, and
they felt the presence of thousands of people. M. Mifroid managed to get
one of the lamps, and quickly pressing the button, lit up the vast hall,
in which were crowded thousands of these weird men, all with the large
noses and ears, but with no eyes. Some of them walked on all fours, and
some had such long noses that they looked like pelicans.
</p>
<p>
Finally they were informed that they were at the entrance to the meeting
hall.

CHAPTER XXXIV
</h2>
<h3>
<i>M. Mifroid Performs on the Stage</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NE would never have expected to drop from one of the numberless ways in
the catacombs into a city of twenty thousand inhabitants. However, upon
reflection, one would wonder why men, taken out of their natural
environment, would not be susceptible to the same natural changes as the
animals.
</p>
<p>
Arajo relates to us how he saw flocks of blind ducks come out of the
caverns of the subterranean lake of Zirhnitz. One is bound to believe that
these ducks were the products of ducks which once saw clearly, but which
were shut up by some accident in the bowels of the earth, in the midst of
obscure waters. And so there is some logic in the theory that if the
family of a man in the first years of the fourteenth century was by
accident confined in the catacombs, it would live there and produce
offspring. At the end of the third generation they would have forgotten
the existence of the open world. Of course they would continue to speak
the language, and as no strange element would mix with it, it would
preserve its purity through centuries.
</p>
<p>
Then in the darkness they would lose the use of their eyes, but develop
their sense of touch as blind men do. Hence the excess of digits on their
hands and feet. Then the loss of one sense always develops all the other
senses in proportion. After centuries these super-developed senses become
abnormal, and the nose and ears develop accordingly in size.
</p>
<p>
And so it was with these people of the Talfa. Their features had developed
to an extraordinary extent, and their idea of beauty in the human form was
based on the excessive development of these features. Demoiselle de Coucy
was considered the most beautiful of all the Talfa.
</p>
<p>
They had entered the large meeting room, and M. Mifroid attempted to again
light his lamp, but the crowd cried out in such disgust that he was
persuaded to keep it out. He endeavored to converse with those near by.
Their names were among the most illustrious in France at the time of the
Battle of Crecy. But they addressed themselves in a tone so ineffably
sweet, and all the uproar they tried to make resulted in an enchanting
murmur. It was difficult to imagine that such sweet and honeyed words
could emanate from such ugly beings.
</p>
<p>
M. Mifroid was seated on a chair next to Lady Jane de Montfort, who
continually felt his face and touched his ears. While her curiosity was
great she approached him with such delicate gracefulness that he hadn&rsquo;t
the heart to restrain her.
</p>
<p>
Soon there was a great silence, and a concert began. To Mifroid and
Théophraste nothing was to be heard. Occasionally the people applauded
quietly, but the absolute silence of the performers was a striking
feature. Not a word was heard.
</p>
<p>
Soon there was much talking again around the two men, and they learned
that it was intended that they should go down on the stage. This was the
reason why they had been dragged to the meeting hall. They were to be
exhibited as a phenomenon. Théophraste willingly consented, as his
companion had promised him a good duck for dinner. M. Mifroid was not so
easily persuaded, but at last acquiesced, and they descended to the stage.
They all clamored for a song, and M. Mifroid started one of the old French
songs of the fourteenth century, which he had learned as a boy. He had
hardly started the first verse, when everybody in the hall called out for
him to sing lower.
</p>
<p>
He started again, this time moderating his voice, but again they called to
him to sing lower. The third time he could hardly hear himself, so low was
his voice, but this did not satisfy his audience, and he left the platform
with his song unfinished. He afterward learned that the sense of hearing
of these people was so developed that they could understand silent music.

<h3>
<i>A New Trade</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>FTER the concert the party went out of the hall, and passed on to a
striking mansion in which a sumptuous repast was served. M. Mifroid had by
this time become quite intimate with the Lady de Montfort. He confessed
that he was unable to withstand the allurements of the lady. It must not
be forgotten that the darkness was most conducive to the failure of all
his honorable intentions. However, we will not dilate upon what happened,
but Mme. de Montfort weakened him with her caresses and M. Mifroid at last
succumbed to the temptation. After a while she slept, and he opened the
door and went out.
</p>
<p>
Although they had been among the Talfa several hours, neither M. Mifroid
nor Théophraste had had the inclination to see what kind of habitation
they were in. Weakness and the great crowd of Talfa had prevented them.
</p>
<p>
M. Théophraste had conducted himself in such a manner during the meal,
eating everything to excess, that he had had to be carried out. It was
done according to the directions of Mme. de Coucy, who, it is feared,
would not at that time have carried on her love intrigues.
</p>
<p>
Now M. Mifroid found himself alone, and he decided to investigate. As he
went out of the room, he realized that he was in a subterranean city.
</p>
<p>
That which struck him most was the total absence of doors. All the shops
were open to the passers-by, and the most precious articles as well as the
poorest were exposed for any one to take who wished.
</p>
<p>
He was very much amused by the profusion of the columns, by the incredible
carving in the friezes, by the reliefs and sculptured caps to the pillars.
They were so extravagantly flowered, with the lines so intricate, that
only a master hand could have worked them. A curious point about all this
work was that it only reached as high as a man could touch. Above that
point the design mixed in with the vaulting of the catacombs and was left
to the imagination. But whatever was seen of this beautiful carving could
only be compared with the marvels worked by the early sculptors of India
or the ivory-carvers of Burma.
</p>
<p>
In the search M. Mifroid did not come upon any large building. He had
frequently heard Mademoiselle say: &ldquo;Ah, St. Mary!&rdquo; And so he tried to find
some temple in order to find out what their religion was. His search,
however, was in vain. The only building of any size was the concert hall
where they had been earlier. It was certainly more wonderful than all the
rest, but except for this one example all the architectural marvels were
applied to the private buildings. The meanest aperture, the poorest door,
were little gems of art. There were no statues in the squares.
</p>
<p>
M. Mifroid was just starting back to his lady&rsquo;s house, when he met a party
of young Talfa, armed with cross-bows. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;here are the
guards.&rdquo; He was, however, quickly undeceived, for they had smelled the
odor from his lamp, and they came up to him. They told him they were going
for a hunt. The hunting season started every year on the rising of the
waters of the great lake. At this time there were always a lot of rats,
which were killed in thousands and used for many different things in the
Talfa households.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to the directions they had given him, he soon found his way back to
Lady de Montfort&rsquo;s house. There he found her waiting at the window, and as
soon as he got near her, she waved her handkerchief.
</p>
<p>
They were soon in conversation again, and he found out that she was not
married.
</p>
<p>
She asked him what he did on the top of the earth, and he told her he was
a commissioner of police. She listened intently, and asked what
Théophraste did.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He is a robber,&rdquo; said M. Mifroid.
</p>
<p>
Evidently neither a commissioner of police nor a robber was known among
the Talfa, and soon the news spread that the two strangers had unknown
trades, and a great crowd gathered, who begged them to show them what they
did on earth.
</p>
<p>
M. Mifroid sent to fetch Théophraste.

<h3>
<i>A Robber is Caught</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Théophraste was brought up to M. Mifroid, he was in a pitiful
condition. He had given himself up to the worst debauchery, and was still
under the influence of his excesses.
</p>
<p>
However, M. Mifroid explained to him what was required of him. He had to
demonstrate to the Talfa people the duties of a police commissioner, and
Théophraste was to act the robber and be arrested. However, owing to
Théophraste&rsquo;s condition, M. Mifroid had his misgivings as to the result of
this practical demonstration.
</p>
<p>
The crowd by this time had assumed enormous proportions, and by special
permission an electric lamp was lit. All present held their noses as if
the lamp smelled.
</p>
<p>
Then M. Mifroid instructed Théophraste. He told him to run into a store
and take some things, and run out. This was an easy matter, as none of the
stores had doors, and Théophraste commenced to act the robber. He ran into
a hatter&rsquo;s and seized all sorts of rat-skin caps. He instinctively put
them under his coat, and hid them about his person, looking furtively
around him in a most natural way.
</p>
<p>
All this time the people around the store looked on noiselessly. No one
said anything and not the least sign of surprise was shown. One man at
length said: &ldquo;Look at that fellow providing himself with hats for a year.
It was then that M. Mifroid came upon the scene, and seizing Théophraste
by the arm, said in his most official tone: &ldquo;In the name of the law, I
arrest you!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This did not produce the desired effect, as the people still preserved
their dumbness, and did not appear at all impressed.
</p>
<p>
Mlle. de Coucy asked M. Mifroid what he meant by &ldquo;In the name of the law.&rdquo;
 But as the Talfa people had no law, he found it difficult to explain.
</p>
<p>
He told her how the police was an institution to protect the person and
property of peaceable citizens. They were the guardians of the law. He,
however, could not make them understand, as they thought Théophraste had a
right to the hats.
</p>
<p>
Lady de Montfort explained that they had no need of laws to protect the
state, as they had no state, nor the property, as they had no property,
and as individuals never conflicted no law was necessary to protect
persons. All the Talfa people did was to hunt for their food and make
clothing from the skins of rats. Marriage to them was a prehistoric
institution which appeared unworthy of the human state. They only half
believed its existence as a sacred legend. Their unions were of a very
liberal nature, and did not require any ceremony or oath. Consequently
they lived together peacefully and happily.
</p>
<p>
A curious feature of these Talfa people was the entire absence of any code
of morals. There was no difference made between a virtuous woman and one
of loose habits. Everybody lived on the same footing and enjoyed the same
privileges. Things happened according to taste and temperament, and nobody
thought anything about it. Thus conflicts of passion were reduced to a
minimum. No one had rights, as no one possessed anything.
</p>
<p>
Thus lived the Talfa people. No laws, no trouble, and no police
commissioners.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXXVII
</h2>
<h3>
<i>The Escape from the Catacombs</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>. THEOPHRASTE LONGUET had by this time quite forgotten the ties which
bound him to the world above, and while M. Mifroid was abandoning himself
to the fancies of Lady de Montfort, he was indulging in excesses of
debauchery with the Talfa people.
</p>
<p>
The time came when M. Mifroid became tired of this kind of life. They had
been in the catacombs three weeks and had become acquainted with the
habits of all the Talfa people. M. Mifroid longed to get into the open
world, where people had public affairs and a properly organized society.
He felt confused, and a feeling of weariness came over him.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste was for stopping there altogether. He said he had never had
such a time before. He had been playing the tricks of Cartouche on the
Talfa people, and he felt more free in spirits than he had felt on earth.
He was so persistent In his determination to stay that M. Mifroid decided
to appeal to Mlle, de Coucy. He felt that Théophraste was a nuisance to
the Talfa, and the best way to get him out was to appeal to the people
themselves. Théophraste had even suggested putting out his own eyes to be
like these people.
</p>
<p>
Upon telling Mlle, de Coucy, however, he got a totally different answer
than he expected. She told him that the Talfa people had decided to let
them go as soon as twenty thousand people had passed their fingers over
their faces. She explained that the Talfa had forever been trying to get
into the upper world, and therefore they must all visit these men from the
coveted realms and see what they looked like before their departure.
</p>
<p>
M. Mifroid calculated that it would take some time to complete this
ceremony, and so he devised a plan by which they could deceive the people
and escape. They were never long alone, and all day and all night fingers
were feeling their faces and were thrust into their eyes, nose or mouth.
It was during these operations one night that M. Mifroid devised his plan
of escape. He would utilize his powers as a sculptor.
</p>
<p>
Obtaining some clay from the bed of the lake he modeled two masks like
those of the Talfa people with large noses and ears. Then under the
pretense of acquiescing in Théophraste&rsquo;s wishes, who dreamed only of
becoming a Talfa, he put one of the masks on his face, and the other he
wore himself. The deception was perfect, and although they met several
Talfa they were not recognized, in spite of much finger feeling.
</p>
<p>
M. Mifroid took the precaution of providing himself with food, and they
both started out. Théophraste laughed with delight at the bold deception,
and in his merriment he did not realize that M. Mifroid had led him out of
the domains of the Talfa. They walked for five days. Their eyes had by
this time become accustomed to the darkness, and they were able to make
good headway. On the fifth day they came across some human bones, and M.
Mifroid uttered a prayer of thankfulness, for here were signs of a
civilized people. They were on the outskirts of the city of Ossarium.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste had been in a very depressed state of mind since leaving the
Talfa. He had continually reproached M. Mifroid for getting him away. Upon
coming upon the first signs of human existence, M. Mifroid drew his
attention to them and declared that in a short time they would be out in
the light of day again.
</p>
<p>
Soon they came across a skull with the signs of a candle near it, showing
Catholic burial, then the gallery seemed to dip down, the ground became
wet, and they found themselves wading through mire. Water dripped on them
from crevices above, and the air became cold and damp. At last M. Mifroid
recognized a part of the gallery, and again he sent a prayer up to heaven
for his deliverance.
</p>
<p>
There was a Latin inscription cut out of the rock: &ldquo;Ossa arida audite
verbum Domini,&rdquo; which M. Mifroid recognized as being near an entrance to
the catacombs.
</p>
<p>
They had not proceeded far when voices were heard, and they found
themselves in a large vault. This was a very different place than the hall
of the Talfa, though. There were ordinary human beings here. Through the
whole length of the hall chairs were arranged. The place was lit up by
numerous candles enclosed in human skulls. At the end was a kind of
rotunda where evidently the musicians sat, for a large circle of
music-stands were arranged. A number of people were present getting ready
for a feast. No one took any notice of the two strangers, as it was
thought that they were invited guests, and they strolled through, watching
the proceedings. Soon the musicians began to arrive one by one, and the
people sat around making pleasantries, and passing the time away in talk.
It was half-past one.
</p>
<p>
It was indeed a curious sight. Here down among the dead, with coffins and
bones all around, had assembled a crowd to listen to music, and to make
revelry. Fifty musicians had assembled, among whom M. Mifroid recognized
many of the orchestra of the Opera House.
</p>
<p>
Soon the music started, Chopin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dead March&rdquo; being the first piece. After
listening for some time M. Mifroid tapped Théophraste on the shoulder,
whispering to him that it was time to go. They hurried along, and ten
minutes later they found themselves on the earth again.
</p>
<p>
They walked together for about half an hour, neither uttering a word. They
were both thinking what a wonderful experience they had gone through. The
Talfa nation, with its peculiar habits, had impressed them wonderfully,
and neither wished to disturb the other in contemplation of it all.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Théophraste said: &ldquo;What are you waiting for, M. Mifroid? Do you
intend to arrest me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
M. Mifroid had, in the emotion of the moment, forgotten his original
mission. He, however, had become very friendly with Théophraste in the
catacombs, in spite of his excesses, and so, now that he was confronted
with the necessity of arresting him, he said: &ldquo;No, my friend, I shall not
arrest you. My mission was to arrest Cartouche, but as Cartouche is no
more, I cannot arrest him. Besides, you, M. Longuet, are my friend.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
They then parted at the Buci Crossway.

<h3>
An Old Friend
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>FTER the footsteps of M. Mifroid had died away, M. Longuet remained
standing at the street corner. A feeling of intense sadness and loneliness
had come over him. He could not decide on whether to go back to his wife
or to leave her altogether. But what would he do? If he left her he would
have no home, and he would be an outcast from the world. He wandered for a
long time through the streets, until he found himself opposite a door in
the Rue Suger. He rang the bell and a man in a blouse and paper cap opened
the door in response.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good-evening, Ambrose,&rdquo; said Théophraste. &ldquo;Are you up at this hour? I
would not have disturbed you, but many things have happened since I last
saw you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He had not seen him since the evening he came to ask his opinion on the
watermark on the old paper.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Ambrose cordially. &ldquo;Make yourself at home. How are all the
folks at home?&rdquo; &ldquo;I will tell you all to-morrow. What I want now is some
sound sleep. I am tired out.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Ambrose showed him his own bed, and soon Théophraste was stretched out and
asleep.
</p>
<p>
The following day Ambrose tried to get some news from Théophraste, who,
however, observed an absolute silence, and would not be persuaded to say a
word. He was like a dumb man. He passed his time for two days in examining
words and papers, which filled his pockets, and in writing, but always
without saying a word.
</p>
<p>
One morning as he was preparing to go out, Ambrose asked him: &ldquo;Where are
you going?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am going to see M. Mifroid about the details of a trip we took
together, and of which you will learn when I am dead.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are going to kill yourself?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no. There is no use in doing that. I shall die soon enough. But I
shall come to your house to die, my dear Ambrose. After going to see M.
Mifroid, I shall go to see my wife.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I did not dare to ask about her. Your sadness and silence made me fear
some domestic trouble. It is all so inexplicable.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She still loves me,&rdquo; said Théophraste.
</p>
<p>
Before letting him go, Ambrose made him change his underclothes, and lent
him a clean shirt, as he said he could not see his wife decently in the
rags he was in at present.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will put it on,&rdquo; said Théophraste, &ldquo;for my own sake, as my wife won&rsquo;t
see it. I&rsquo;m not going near her. I shall only see her from a distance. I
only want to learn if she is happy.&rdquo;

CHAPTER XXXIX
</h2>
<h3>
<i>The Final Tragedy</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening, the season was well advanced, and a
heavy mist hung over the land. M. Longuet went up the long drive toward
the &ldquo;Villa Flots de Azure.&rdquo; His hand trembled as he cautiously pushed open
the little garden gate. He crossed the garden step by step, to look
around. His whole demeanor was one of evil intent. There was a light in
the parlor, and the window was half open. With short steps Théophraste
advanced, and stretching his head he peered in.
</p>
<p>
He fell back groaning. Placing his hands over his face, he tore the white
locks on his forehead. The sight had frenzied him, and he felt a pang of
agonizing jealousy go through his frame.
</p>
<p>
Marceline and Adolphe were there, locked in affectionate embrace! This is
what he had come to see! His wife no doubt was happy, but in quite a
different way from what he expected.
</p>
<p>
He sat down on the ground and wept with rage. Rising, his curiosity forced
him to get nearer and listen.
</p>
<p>
What he heard only made him worse, and he inwardly felt that he was about
to commit a great crime. However, he battled against this feeling, and ran
away from the house. Something compelled him to return!
</p>
<p>
In a state of sanguinary expectation, comparable to nothing in the history
of crimes, he again retraced his steps, found himself in the garden again,
and without waiting to look in he bounded into the parlor.
</p>
<p>
M. Lecamus and Marceline were taken aback, and both uttered a cry of
surprise. Their surprise was soon turned to terror, as Théophraste,
seizing some stout cord, ran to Adolphe, and with superhuman strength and
agility bound him hand and foot. Dragging him to the hall, he tied him to
a newel post and left him. It was all done with such lightning speed that
Adolphe hadn&rsquo;t the time to resist the first attack, and he was as a child
in the ferocious grip of Théophraste.
</p>
<p>
Turning around he ran to the sitting-room, and seized an old sword that
was hanging on the wall. Marceline in her terror called to Lecamus to mind
his ears. She feared that he would undergo the same treatment as Signor
Petito. However, nothing was further from Théophraste&rsquo;s thoughts, for
turning on Marceline he struck her down with one blow. Two seconds later
he was holding her head up to Adolphe, saying: &ldquo;Haste thee now to kiss
these lips while they are still warm.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Adolphe could do nothing, so he touched the lips of the dead woman, and
then fell in a faint.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste ran upstairs, and brought down from the garret an old trunk,
and in less than twenty-five minutes he had the body of Marceline cut up
and placed in it. He closed the trunk with a key, and putting it over his
shoulder he said good-by to Lecamus. However, he might have said good-by
to the door-post, for Lecamus was in a dead faint and choking from the
cords around his neck.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste and the trunk disappeared in the darkness.
</p>
<p>
That same night one could have seen a man on a barge in the Seine
discharging the contents of a trunk into the river. They could also have
heard him murmur: &ldquo;My poor Marceline, my poor Marceline! It was not your
fault.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
At dawn Théophraste knocked at Ambrose&rsquo;s door. Ambrose saw that he was
greatly agitated, and asked him in sympathetic tones what had happened.
</p>
<p>
Théophraste could not reply. His tongue seemed riveted to his mouth. He
crawled to the bed, and, lying down, wept.
</p>
<p>
At last Ambrose was able to console him sufficiently to get these few
words from him: &ldquo;I felt the flame of murder pass through my veins. The
impulse to kill had returned to me after centuries. The same impulse that
had made me decapitate my faithless wife, Marie Antoinette Neron, two
hundred years previously, and to throw her body into the river. I forgive
M. Lecamus. When I am dead go and look for him and tell him that I name
him my testamentary executor. I leave him all my worldly goods. He will
know what to do with the little oaken chest, in which is locked the
terrible secrets of the last months of my sad life.&rdquo; Having said these
words, Théophraste raised himself on the pillow, for the oppression
increased, and he knew that the end was near. His look was no longer of
this world. His gaze was fixed on some imaginary object far away, and in a
doleful voice he said: &ldquo;I have seen-I see-I turn again toward the square
ray of light.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And he expired!

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
